The World's
Biggest Airport
The world's busiest airport today is in the USo Nearly
54 million passengers pass through Hartsfield-Jackson
Atlanta International Airport every year. However, by the
end of the next decade there's going to be a new airport
even bigger and busier than Atlanta. The new airport is
going to be in the capital of China: Beijing.
Beijing already has two airports. The first is Beijing Capital
International Airport, where an extra terminal was built
for the 2008 Olympic Games. The second is Beijing
Nanyuan Airport, which is mainly used by military planes.
Just over 73 million passengers passed through Beijing
Capital Airport last year, making it the second busiest after
Atlanta. But the current airport is not big enough for all
the Chinese passengers who want to travel by plane. This
is w hy the government is going to build a new one.
The new airport is going to be in the suburb of Oaxing, in
the south of the dty. Daxing is about an hour's drive from
the center of the dty. The government is going to extend
Beijing's subway so that passengers can reach it more
easily. There are also plans for a high-speed train line. The
airport is going to have eight runways for commerdal
flights, and a ninth runway for military use. This is going to
make it the biggest and the busiest airport in the world.

Men and women aH over the
world have arguments about doing
housework, and it's usuaHy the
women who lose. However, a study
by researchers at the University of
Michigan in the US shows that the
situation is slowly improving.
The researchers asked 8,000 American families how
much time they spent on housework each week. The
researchers have asked the same 8,000 families the same
questions every year since 1968. Then. ea eh year. the
researchers analyze the information.

The information showed that women in the US today
spend about 16 hours a week doing housework. Men, on
the other hand, spend about 12 hours a week doing the
same things. Although women still spend more time doing
domestic jobs. the figures show that the situatian has
improved. In the 1970s, women spent about 26 hours a
week on housework and men only seven hours a week.
Researchers say that women are still doing most of the
housework beca use people still divide domesticjobs into
two areas. They see cooking, cleaning, and taking care of
the children as "women's work," and general repairs, car
maintenance, and work outside the home as "men's work."
So, in general, the results of the study bring good news
for women. The difference between the amount of time
men and women spend on housework is getting smaller
every year. This means the time will come when both
sexes share domestic chores equally. However, women
will have to be extremely patient beca use the change
won't be complete anytime soon!

How much fruit do you eat every day? And how many
vegetables? Food experts today think that we don't
have enough of these foods in our diet, and they say
that we eat too much fat and sugar. This is why the
World Health Organization has started a campaign
to encourage us to eat more fruits and vegetables.
The campaign in the US is called Fruits á: VeggiesMore Matters.

Why eat fruits
and vegeta bies?
Fruits and vegeta bies are fuI! of important vitamins and minerals
that our bodies need to be healthy. Scientific studies have shown
that eating a lot of them can prevent some illnesses like diabetes
and obesity. Also, fruits and vegetables don't conta in mu ch fat.
and they don't have many ca lories, so they help us to keep thin.

What counts?
Almost all fruits and vegeta bies eount towa rd your fi ve a day,
except potatoes. The food ca n be fresh, frozen, or in a can, like
peaches or peas.lt can be raw, eooked, or even dried, like raisins
or banana chips. Aglass of lOO-percent fruit juice with no added
sugar also counts as one serving.

How much is a serving?
Aserving of fresh fruit or vegeta bies depends on the size of the food.
In the case of small-sized fruit like plums or mandarin oranges, one
serving is two pieces offruit. Apiece of medium-sized fruit like an
apple, an orange, or apear also counts as one serving. With larger
fruit like melon and pineapple, one serving is a one-half cup or about
3 ounces. We use the same method for ca lculating servings with
vegetables. ln the case ofsalad vegetables, a medium-sized tomato
or 15-inch piece of cucumber eount as one serving each. Forsmaller,
cooked vegeta bies like beans and carrots, one serving is three large
spoonfuls of vegetables.

4 REAOING
a Read rhe artide. Is rhe writer genera lly positive or
negative abour mothers-in-law?
e

The truth about
mothers-in-law
Although it's men who tell jokes
about t hem, mothers-in-Iaware
usually less popular with their
daughters-in-Iaw (han wi th the ir
sons-in-Iaw. A recent 5tudy of

49 married couples found that
two thirds of wives interviewed

said that their mothers-in-Iaw caused them "unhappiness and
stress," compared with 15 percent of (he husbands.
There are a number of reasons for this. First of all, there is
the question of experience. A mother-in -law has already
raised a fami ly of her own, so she feels that she has a
lot of knowledge to pass on.ln this situation, it is very difficult
for her to keep quiet. However, when a daughter-in-Iaw is a
new mother, she usua lly wants to find her own way of doing
things. She often interprets her mother-in-Iaw's advice as
criticism, which can cause a conflict.
Secondly, there is the case of the husband. 80th women
ca re for him, although each of them laves him in a different
way. On the one hand, he is the mother-in-law's son, and she
obviously wants the best for him. On the other hand, he is
the wife's partner, and she wants him to support her. 80th
women can get very upset if they see the man taking sides,
and this can cause an argumento
However, mothers-in-Iaw actually have a lot to offer, despite
their reputation for causing trouble. They are generally
excellent babysitters, and they don't mind he lping with the
housework. As long as they have their own independent
lives and help out only when needed, mothers-in-law can
playa very useful ro le in any fam ily. The important thing
is that they should not get too involved in their sons' and
daughters' relationships so that nobody feels bad.

Underline five words you don'r know. Use your
dietionary to look up their meaning and pronunciation.

other people like me. l'm more interested in using English to communicate
than anything else, so I don't mind if my grammar isn't perfecto

Paolo. Portugal
I don't have time to go to an English class, but there's a great site on the Internet
that has classes in the form of podcasts. Every week, I download a few of these
anta my phone so that I can listen to the class when I'm going to and from work.
I find the words and phrases that I have to listen to and repeat extremely useful.

Suzen. Turkey
I'm a big fan of American pop music, so I spend a lot of time listening to
different songs at home on my iPad. I've downloaded a new app that puts the
Iyrics on the screen and trans lates the song for you at the same time. I really
enjoy learning English like this, and ¡t's very good for my pronunciation, too.

Kiko.Japan
I can't afford t o pay for one-on-one English classes, but I've found a great
class online. I have to watch a short video, and then learn the grammar and
vocabu lary in it.lf I have any questions, l ean contact my online tutor who's
very friend ly. I'm really enjoying the class, and I've learned a lot from it.

Luis. Spain
Ilove books, and in my opinion, you can learn a lot of new words by reading in
English.I look up difficult words with my dictionary or do a quick search online.
Also, I can read a book whenever I want. 1don't have to go to classes or paya
lot of money for private tutors. Books are great.1 can learn English and about
other subjects, too!

2 T here are a lar of rhings you can do i f a crocodile attacks yO ll.
3 T here's only one thing ro do if a crocodile attacks yO ll .
Well, most of these are possible - the best thing to do depends on
where the crocodile is at the time. If it comes toward you on land,
experts say you should turn around and run away as fast as possible.
Crocodiles can run faster than humans over a short distance, but they
soon get tired. If they miss their first chance to catch their ~
they usually start looking for something else.
If you're in the water, then ¡;sp:las.fi] around to make a noise so that the
animal gets co nfused. If this doesn't work, push your thumb or fingers
into the crocodile's eye. Thi s is the most sensitive area of the crocodile's
body, and it is the pla ce where you can cause the animal the most pain .
It wi ll also be very surprised by your attack, and it's possible that it
will decide to leave you alone. Don't try and open the crocod il e's mouth
because the muscles are so strong that this is almost impossible.
However, if the crocodile is in abad mood, it's possible that it wi ll continue
fighting. Your final opportunity is to pretend to be dead. If t he crocodile
thinks that its victim is dead, it opens its mouth for a few seconds to move
the body into its throat. This ca n give you your last chance to escape, but
it's a very dangerous plan.
Our final advice? It's much better to avoid crocodiles than to do any of the
things above ...

".144m Listen ro a radio program about the
American actress and singer Judy Garland and
her daughter, Liza Minnelli. How old were they
when they first performed on stage? _ _ _ __

r.a=J On Oecember 8, 1980, one of John Lennon's fans shot
him outside his apartment. Since then, both of his san s have
become musicians. Julian Lennon has made six albums and
Sean Lennon has sung and played bass guitar with a number of
different bands. So far, however, neither of them have been as

successful as their father.

~ John Lennon was born in Liverpool on October 9, 1940.
His parents separated when he was five, so he went to live
with an aunt and uncle. However, he stayed in contact with his

mother, who played him Elvis Presley records and taught him
how to play the banjo.

II.J Before The Beatles broke up in 1970, John met the
Japanese artist, Yoko Ono, and he divorced his first wife. He
left the band and continued making music both Dn his awn and
with Yoko. Their son, Sean, was born on October 9, 1975 and
John stayed at home to take ca re of him.

DI] When John was 15, his mother bought him his first guitar.
He formed his first band called The Quarrymen while he was
still at school. When he graduated from high school, he too k
classes at Liverpool College of Art but the band too k up a lot
of his time, so he didn't graduate from college.

~ The band released its first single "Love Me Do" in
October, 1962. They started touring the country. John married
his first wife, Cynthia, in secret, and his first son, Julian, was
born while they were away. Fans went crazy wherever The
Beatles played, and all of their albums reached the number one
spot on the charts.

IIJJ The singer-songwriter and guitarist John Lennon is one
of the greatest musicians of all time. Songs like "Give Peace a
Chance" and "Imagine" made him famous all over the world.

m:=l

John met Paul McCartney at the second performance of
The Quarrymen, and he soon joined the bando Later, George
Harrison joined them as lead guitarist. In 1960, they became
The Beatles, and they started looking for a drummer. Ringo
Starr replaced their original drummer, Pete Best, in 1962.

Grenham House, a boarding school in Kent, and
Wellington SchooL a privare school in Somerset.

2 _____________________________________
One thing my schooldays did teach me was rhe importance
of teamwork. At boarding school. I was an outsider and I was
really, tru ly unhappy there. When I started playing sports at
Grenham House, I became a member of a team, and I fett

a lor better abour myself. Like sports, acting is also almost
always a team event, and you rely just as much on other
people as they do on you.

3
Yes, I did. My brother and I both went to the same schooL
and sometimes, we used to break the ruLes. In private
schooLs at that time, a common punishment used to be
nthe cane": a long stick that the teacher used for hitting
naughty boys.

4 _____________________________________
Well, I wasn't very academic at aLl, reaLLy, and I was very bad
at math. l ucki ly for me, I was rea LLy good at sports and that's
the only reason they accepted me at Wellington. I was on
the school rugby team, and I also played tennis. I played at
Wimbledon once, in the junior tournament, and I got through
to the second round.

5 ____________________________________

Although I was good at sports, I never reaLLy considered
taking it up professionaLLy. Once I left Wellington, I wa nted
to become an actor, and I didn't pLayas many sport s when I
left school.

6
Yes, my favorite teacher was Mr. 5torr, coach of the school
tennis team, and al so my English teacher. One day, when I
was 14 or 15, I had to read in class. After the class, he said
to me, "The way you read suggests you might enjoy acting.
WouLd you consider pLaying Macbeth in the schooL pLayr
That was the beginning of my acting career, and ¡'ve never
looked back since.

For many years, pcople have said that a good night's sleep oEten helps
when you have to make an important decision. Research done
recentIy by an American university has shown that this idea is
actually truco
The researchers used a card game for their experiment, and 54 students
between the ages of 18 and 23 took parto The scienrists divided the
participants into two groups. Both groups were given a short lesson on
how to play rhe card game, either in the morning or in rhe evening. The
lesson was very short- not long enough for either group to learn exactly
how the cardgame worked. All of the students were asked to come back
12 hours latero The 28 students who had the c1ass in the afternoon went
home toa normal evening and theirusual nightof sleep, while the 26
who received rhe c1ass in rhe morning carne back after a day of normal
activities without sleep.
On their second visit, the students played the game for long enough
to learn that taking cards from the four different packs gave different
results. Two of the packs had cards that he\ped players win more
often while the orher two packs had cards th ar made rhem lose.
The object was to avoid losing the game.
In the experiment, the students who had had a normal night's sleep
chose cards from the winning packs four times more than those who
had spent the I2~ hour break awake. The students who had slept also
understood better how ro play the game.
These results show that sleep helps a person make better decisions.
The researchers think rhat this has something ro do wirh rapid~ eye ~
movement. or REM sleep, which is the creative period of our sleep cyele.
The experiment shows that there is a conneetion between REM sleep and
decision making, but researchers do not yet know what the conneetion is.

T

OdaYt there are two thousand families li ving in
the village of Kodinhi in southern India. Among
thern, there are more than 300 sets of twins, wh ich
is six times the global average. What makes this
even more unusual is that India has one of the

lowest birth rates of twins in the wor ld.
Nobody can explain the reason why the vi ll age has
so many twins. Sorne people say the cause might be

genetic, but local doctor, Dr. 5ribiju, doesn't think
so. He says that there haven't always been twins
in Kod inhi - parents sudden ly started having them
about sixty or seventy years ago. Neither does he

believe that a new kind of pollution has caused
the twins to be born. In that case, he argues,
there wou ld be more twins with birth defects
Luckily, most of Kodinhi's twins are born healthy.
Oro Sribiju thinks that the twins are born because of
something the vi llagers eat and drink. He wants to
discover just what that is, so that he can use it to
help other coup les who can't have ch ildren.
Having twins in this part of India can be a big
problem for a family. It's expensive, and it can
be dangerous for the mother's health. That's
why the villagers of Kodinhi have started a
support group . The group is ca lled the Twins
and Kin* Assoc iation, or TAKA for short. The
president of the group is 50-year-old Pul lani
Bhaskaran, who has twin sons of his own. He
wants al l the twins in Kodinhi to join the group
so that they can help each other. With the
more than 300 pairs of twins in the vi llage and
the other people in their families, TAKA currently
has 600 members.

If yo u've lea rn ed American English and you're traveling in Britain,
or jf you've lea rn ed British English and you're t rave ling in the US,
you'll notice some differences. An obvious difference is th e
accent, bu t most t rave lers find that th ey don't have too many
problems wit h t hi s. Th ere are so rn e grammatical differences,
but th ey shouldn't make it difficult t o understand peop le, or
to communicate. That leaves diff erences in vocabula ry, whi ch
ca n ca use misund erst and ing s. Sometim es the difference is only
the spelling, for examp le, in American English center, color, and
traveled, and in Briti sh Eng li sh centre, colour, and travelled. But
somet im es th e wo rd is complete ly different in America n and
British English, so it's a good id ea t o be prepared.
