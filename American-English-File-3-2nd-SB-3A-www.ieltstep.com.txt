between the two adjectives made from stress?
stress (noun) (x2) relax (verb) wake (verb)
sleep (verb) power (noun) benefit (noun)

Ask and answer the questions with a
partner.
1 What time o f day do you usually eat protein
and carbohydrates? How do they make
you feel?
How often do you eat chocolate? Does it
make you feel happier?
After reading the article, is there anything
you would change about your eating habits?

We live in a stressfu l world, and daily life ca n som etim es
m ake u s feel tired , stressed , or depressed. Some people go
to th e doctor for help, oth ers tr y alternative therapies, but
th e place to find a c u re could be som ewhere completely
different: in the kitchen.

D

r. P a u l C layton, a food expert from Middlesex University, says
“The brain is affected by what you eat and drink, just like every
other part of your body. Certain types of food contain substances that
affect how you think and feel."
For example, food that is high in carbohydrates can make us feel more
relaxed. It also makes us feel happy. Research has shown that people on
diets often begin to feel a little depressed after two weeks because they
are eating fewer carbohydrates.
On the other hand, food that is rich in protein makes us feel awake and
focused. Research has shown that schoolchildren who eat a high-protein
breakfast often do better at school than children whose breakfast is
lower in protein. Also, eating the right kind of meal at lunchtime
can make a difference if you have an exam in the afternoon or a
business meeting where you need to make some quick decisions.
In an experiment for a TV show, two chess players, both former
champions, had different meals before playing each other. Paul
had a plate of prosciutto and salad (full of protein from the red
meat), and his opponent Terry had pasta with a creamy sauce (full
of carbohydrates). In the chess match Terry felt sleepy and took
much longer than Paul to make decisions about what moves to make.
The experiment was repeated several times with the same result.
Another powerful mood food could become a replacement
fo r some medications doctors prescribe fo r stress. In a
study, Swiss researchers discovered that eating one dark
chocolate candy bar (about 1.4 ounces) had beneficial
effects on highly stressed people. Not only did eating
the dark chocolate help reduce stress, it was also shown to
improve mood and reduce high blood pressure.
Why does chocolate make people less stressed? First, it
causes the body to reduce the level of the stress hormone
cortisol. Second, it reduces the “fight or flight” hormone—a hormone
that makes people want to start a fight or run away when they are very
stressed. In addition, it contains other compounds that lower blood
pressure and improve your mood. These three things, along with its
delicious taste, make chocolate a powerful mood changer.

M ood food - w hat th e e x p e rts say
• B lueberries and cocoa ca n ra ise concentration levels for up
to five hours.
• Food th a t is high, in protein helps y ou r b ra in to w ork more
efficiently
• F o r relaxation and to sleep better, eat carbohydrates.
• D ark g reen vegetables (e.g., cabbage and spinach) and oily
fish (e.g., salmon) eaten regularly cam. help to fight depression.

THE YOUNGER BROTHER
NOVELIST TIM LOTT
Rivalry between brothers is normal, but
there was a special reason for the tension
between us. 1 was very ill when I was born,
and spent three months in the hospital
with my mother. My brother did not see
her at all during that time because he
went to stay with an aunt. When our
mother returned home, it was with a sick
newborn baby who took all the attention.
No wonder he haled me (although if you
ask Jeff, he will say that he didn’t - we
remember things differently).
My brother and I were completely
different. We shared the same bedroom,
but he was neat, and 1 was really messy.
He was responsible; I was rebellious. He
was sensible; I was emotional. I don’t
have any positive memories of our childhood together,
though there must have been good moments. Je ff says we used to play
“Cowboys and Indians,” but I only remember him trying to suffocate
me under the bedcovers.
My relationship with Je ff has influenced my attitude toward my own
four daughters. If the girls fight, I always think that the younger child
is innocent. But the good news about brothers and sisters is that when
they get older, they value each other more. Je ff is now one of my best
friends, and I like and admire him greatly. For better or for worse, we
share a whole history. It is the longest relationship in my life.
Adapted from T h e T im e s

THE ONLY CHILD
JO U R N A LIST SARAH LEE
I went to boarding school when 1 was seven, and the hardest thing I
found was making friends. Because I was an only child, I just didn’t
know how to do it. The thing is that when you’re an only child, you
spend a lot of your time with adults, and you're often the only child in
a gathering of adults. Your parents go on living more or less
the way they have always lived, only now you are there, too.
I found being an only child interesting because it gave me
a view of the world of adults that children in a big family
might not get. And I know it has, at least partly, made me
the kind of person I am - 1 never like being one of a group,
for example. I f I have to be in a group, I will always try to go
off and do something on my own, or be with just one other
person —I’m not comfortable with being one of a gang.
My parents are divorced now and my mother lives in the US
and my father in the UK. I feel very responsible for them - I
feel responsible for their happiness. I’m the closest relative in
the world to each of them, and I am very aware of tiiat.

FROM THE STREETS
TO SUCCESS!
John DeJoria, an American billionaire businessman, owns several
companies, including John Paul Mitchell Systems, a successful
brand of hair products. However, DeJoria was not always wealthy.
He was the second son of immigrant parents and grew up in a
very poor area of Los Angeles, California. Before forming his hair
product company with only $700, he was a street gang member
for some of his youth, he then worked at low-paying jobs including
encyclopedia salesman, janitor, and insurance salesman, and he
was homeless twice. DeJoria's selfmade rise is an inspiring story.

1 Think o f two people you know personally or
have heard o f who are very rich. Did they...?
a earn their money (how?)
b inherit their money (who from?)
c win it (how?)
2 I f they earned their money, was it because...?
a they were very lucky
b they worked very hard
c they had a special talent
b Now read an interview with a billionaire. How did
he become so rich? Why is his success surprising?
W hat does he do to help homeless people?
c

As a child, you were fairly entrepreneurial, weren’t you?
My first job, at 9 years old, was selling Christmas cards door-todoor. At 10 years old, my brother and I had paper routes. We got
up at 4 o’clock a.m., folded the papers, and delivered them, and
then got ready for school.
As you got older, you continued to work. Is that right?
The job that was one of the most influential experiences you can
imagine was door-to-door selling encyclopedias. Doors literally
slam in your face— maybe 30, 40 doors before the first customer
will actually talk to you and let you in.

Now read the interview again and number the
events in the order in which they happened.
A L?| He was homeless again.
B [_I He delivered newspapers.
C Ld At1investor didn’t give him the money he
had promised him.
D [_] He sold encyclopedias from door-to-door.
E Q He left his wife.
F [_] He was homeless.
G \T\ He sold Christmas cards from door-to-door.
H Q He started a hair product company with $700.
1 Ld He was able to pay his bills on time.

d What do you think you can learn from John’s story?
e

Look at the highlighted words and phrases
related to money and business. W ith a partner,
try to figure out the meanings from context.

f

Complete the questions with one o f the
highlighted words and phrases. Then ask and
answer the questions with a partner.
1 What brand o f hair product do you use? How
long have you used it?
2 Do you know anybody who sells encyclopedias or
other products_______ ? What does he / she sell?
Does he / she enjoy his/ her job?
3 If you needed a _______ to lend you money to
start a business, who would you ask? Why?
4 Have you ever experienced______ from a boss,
a teacher, etc.? How did you feel?

You’ve been homeless, haven’t you?
Twice. Once, when I was about 22 years old. The other time was
when I started John Paul Mitchell Systems in 1980. I wasn't
getting along with my wife at the time. So I had left and had
given her all the money. We had a backer for John Paul Mitchell
Systems putting in a half-million dollars. That money was
supposed to arrive that day. I never got a penny. So I just slept
in my car. And I slept in my car for the first two weeks when I
started the company. So we started with humble beginnings.
Do memories of the streets motivate you?
It sure makes you very appreciative of what you have in your
life. Those who are homeless— like people with kids who are
homeless— I really have a heart for. So I participate in a lot of
charitable organizations that take the homeless off the streets.
What are the biggest problems you’ve faced in business?
The biggest problem is rejection. Any business you start, be
ready for it. The difference between successful people and
unsuccessful people is that the successful people do all the
things the unsuccessful people don’t want to do. When 10 doors
are slammed in your face, go to door number 1 1 , with a smile.
When did you know you had made it?
I was in business two years, and we were able to pay every
single bill on time. We had a couple of thousand dollars
in the bank— $4,000, to be exact. And we said, “ Man
we made it; it’s all downhill now.” It was really hard.
It took a couple years.

5 Do you know anybody who has tried to
succeed in a difficult career (like acting), but
who hasn’t ______yet? Is he / she still trying,
or has he / she given up?

What was the first thing you bought yourself at
that point?
I went to a restaurant. This is the first
time I said I’m going to order off the left
side of the menu, not the right side. The
right side is where the prices are. Carne
asada, guacamole, whatever I wanted.
I didn't even look at the prices. That,
to me, was a pretty big deal.

PEOPLE?

answer the questions.

When bad luck becomes
good luck!
You’ve had a lo t o f bad luck in the past— a bad accident
and some frightening health problems. Does th a t keep
you from doing things in the future that involve luck, like
buying a lo tte ry ticket?
nyone who has bought a ticket for the $500-million
US Powerball jackpot can only dream of having as
much luck as Australian truck driver Bill Morgan. In
case you've never heard of Bill Morgan, his story actually
begins with some very bad luck. First, he was almost crushed
to death by a truck accident at work. The accident did not
kill him, but it did leave Bill with a heart condition. When
he was given medication for the heart condition, Bill had an
allergic reaction that caused a powerful heart attack, which
left him clinically dead for 14 minutes. After being revived by
doctors, Morgan slipped into a coma for 12 days. During this
time, his family was advised to unplug his life support system
not once, but twice. Bill's luck began to change when he
unexpectedly woke up from the coma without any permanent
damage. Bill's bad luck was ending and his heartwarming
story was just beginning.

A

Adapted from c e le b r ity n e tw o r th .c o m

After getting better, the 37-year-old Morgan found a new,
higher-paying job, and asked his long-time girlfriend, Lisa
Wells, to marry him. Lisa said yes. A week later, Morgan
bought a scratch-off lottery ticket at his local newsstand.
Bill scratched the ticket off and realized he had just won
a brand new car! A local TV news station was so amazed
by Bill's story that they sent a crew to do a human interest
story on Bill and his lucky streak. The news crew thought it
would be fun to re-create Bill's buying and scratching off the
ticket right on camera. No one could have predicted what
happened next. The ticket Bill bought for the re-enactment
ended up being a $250,000 winner! And the best part is, it all
happened on live TV (almost causing another heart attack).

Adam decided that he was going too slowly. He increased
his speed to 75 miles an hour— 20 miles an hour over
the speed limit. As Adam passed through a small town,
he was stopped by the police! They were angry that
Adam was speeding, and it meant that Adam lost many
valuable minutes! Another problem Adam had was that
his GPS was programmed to give directions in Spanish
instead of English. This made finding his way to Key West
difficult. As Adam finally approached Key West, the traffic
was getting worse. He was worried about getting stuck so

Linking
We often link words together in English, especially when we speak
fast. We link words:
1 when a word ends in a consonant sound and the next word begins
with a vowel sound, e.g., more^exciting
2 when a word ends in a consonant sound and the next word begins
with the same consonant sound, e.g., the fastest^train
3 when a word ends in /t/ or /d/ and the next word begins with HI or
/d/, e.g., the biggest^dog

b Talk to a partner. For each group o f three things compare them
using the bold adjective, i.e., for 1 decide which is the most
dangerous, and then compare the other two. Say why.
1 dangerous: riding a bike; riding a motorcycle; driving
2 easy: learning to drive; learning to ride a bike; learning to ride
a horse
3 relaxing: flying; traveling by train; driving
4 difficult: sleeping on a train; sleeping in a plane; sleeping
on a bus
5 boring: being stuck in a traffic jam; waiting at an airport;
waiting for a bus
I think riding a bike is the most dangerous because
sometimes drivers don’t notice bike riders. Riding
a motorcycle is more dangerous than driving.

esearch by psychologists at the University of
Arizona has shown that the stereotype that
women talk more than men may not be true. In
the study, hundreds of college students were fitted
with recorders, and the total number of words they
used during the day was then counted.

The results, published in the New Scientist, showed that
women speak about 16,000 words a day and men speak
only slightly fewer. In fact, the four most talkative people
in the study were all men.
Professor Matthias Mehl, who was in charge of the
research, said that he and his colleagues had expected to
find that women were more talkative.

GOSSIP WITH THE
GIRLS? JUST PICK ANY
ONE OF FORTY SUBJECTS
omen are experts at gossiping - and they often
talk about trivial things, or at least that's what
men have always thought. However according to
research done by Professor Petra Boynton, a psychologist
at University College London,
when women talk to women their
conversations are not trivial at all, and
cover many more topics (up to 40) than
when men talk to other men.

Women's conversations range from

Almost everything, in fact, except
soccer. Men tend to talk about fewer
subjects, the most popular being work,
sports, jokes, cars, and women.

b According to the article Gossip with the girls?, who do you think
would probably say 1 -4 , a man or a woman?
However, they had been skeptical of the
common belief that women use three times as
many words as men. This idea became popular
after the publication of a book called The
Fem ale Brain (2006) whose author, Louann
Brizendine, claimed that “a woman uses about
20,000 words per day, whereas a man uses
about 7,000.”
Professor Mehl accepts that many people will
find the results difficult to believe. However, he
thinks that this research is important because
the stereotype, that women talk too much and
men keep quiet, is bad not only for women but
also for men. “It says that to be a good male, it’s
better not to talk - that silence is golden.”

Professor Boynton interviewed over 1,000
women for her study. She also found that women
move quickly from one subject to another in
conversation, whereas men usually stick to one
subject for longer periods of time.
Professor Boynton also says that men and women
talk for different reasons. In social situations,
women use conversation to solve problems and
reduce stress, while men talk to each other to
laugh or to exchange opinions.

-edand -ing adjectives
Many adjectives for feelings have two possible
forms, either ending in -ed or in -ing, e.g.,
frustrated and frustrating.
We use the adjective ending in -ed for the person
who has the feeling (I was very frustrated that I
couldn't scuba dive). We use the adjective ending
in -ing for a person or situation that produces the
feeling (/ couldn’t join in the conversation, which
was very frustrating).

Read the information box. Then complete the
adjectives with -ed or -ing.

should have
We use should have to talk about something that
happened in the past th a t you think was wrong, e.g., You
should have written me a thank-you letter. = you didn’t
write to me. I think this was wrong.

Two sides to every story
By NEWS ONLINE Reporter
Everyone knows it can be difficult to get along with your in-laws,
but for 29-year-old Heidi Withers, it may now be impossible.
Heidi was invited to spend the weekend with her fiance Freddie's
family at their house. But soon after they returned home, Heidi
received a very nasty email from Carolyn Bourne, Freddie's
stepmother, criticizing her manners.

d

Now read some o f the comments that were posted on
the Internet. Write H next to the ones that support
Heidi and C next to the ones that support Carolyn.

1 Mrs. Bourne says Heidi should have sent a handwritten
thank-you note... however, she sends this letter by email!
We are in the 21st century. Nobody sends handwritten
letters anymore. 07/13/2011 6:52 p.m.
2 Why do we hear nothing about Freddie’s role in all this?
Why didn't he prepare Heidi? He must know what his
stepmother is like. He could also have prepared his
family by telling them about any eating problems his
girlfriendhas. 07/13/2011 4:25 p.m.
3 The email was a private communication. I don't think
Heidi should have sent it on to her friends. It makes
me think that Mrs. Bourne might be right about her bad
manners. 07/13/2011 12:40 p.m.
Here are a few examples of your lack of manners:
• When you are a guest in another person’s house, you
should not declare what you will and will not eat - unless
you are allergic to something.

4 The stepmother seems to be extremely jealous of Heidi.
Maybe she wants to keep Freddie all to herself. If I were
Heidi, I would leave him. 07/12/2011 10:15 a.m.
5 The mother-in-law may have a few good points, but she
should have spoken to Heidi face-to-face, and not sent
her an email. 07/11/2011 6:50 p.m.

• You should not say that you do not have enough food.
• You should not start before everyone else.
• You should not take extra helpings without being invited to
by your host.

6 I think that the one with the extremely bad manners is
Mrs. Bourne. 07/11/2011 2:10 p.m.

• You should not lie in bed until late morning.

7 Mrs. Bourne, I agree with every word you say. Young
people just don't have any manners nowadays. I hope
Freddie comes to his senses and finds someone better.
07/11/2011 9:48 a.m.

• You should have sent a handwritten note after the visit.
You have never written to thank me when you have stayed.
Heidi was shocked, and immediately sent the email on to
some of her close friends. Surprised and amused, the friends
forwarded it to other people, and soon the email had been
posted on several websites, with thousands of people writing
comments about the mother-in-law.

Turn it off!

Adapted from The New York Times

Something historic happened at
the New York Philharmonic on
the evening of January 10,2012,
about an hour into Mahler's Ninth
Symphony. During the beautiful
fourth movement, an audience
member’s cell phone loudly rang.
And rang. And rang again. It was the kind of marimba riff we've
all heard on the street from a stranger’s phone.
From my seat in Row L, I could see the horrified discomfort of
the other audience members from their body language. We all
wondered whether the conductor Alan Gilbert would react, and
how. Suddenly there was silence. The orchestra had stopped
playing. Mr. Gilbert had halted the performance. He turned to
the man, who was seated in the front row, and said:
“Are you going to turn it off? Will you do that?”
There was some "discussion” between the conductor and the
cell phone owner, but we couldn’t hear it.
In the Avery Fisher Hall, many members of the audience stood
and demanded that the man leave the hall. They were so furious
that I could have imagined them dragging him from his seat on
to the stage, tying him to a stake, and setting him alight!
When the “power off" button on the man’s phone had finally
been located and put to use, Mr. Gilbert turned to the audience.
"Usually, when there’s a disturbance like this, it’s best to ignore
it,” he said. “But this time I could not allow it.”
The audience applauded as if Mahler himself, the orchestra’s
conductor from 1909 to 1911, had suddenly been resurrected
onstage. Mr. Gilbert neither smiled nor acknowledged the
cheers. Instead he turned to the orchestra, instructing the
players to resume, several bars back from the point at which
he had stopped the performance. Just before, he raised his
baton and turned again to the audience and said, this time
with a smile, “We’ll start again.” A few seconds later, the fourth
movement resumed.
Mr. Gilbert’s brave decision that night brought new music to
the Philharmonic.

If I bounce the ball five times...
MATTHEW SYED writes about
sports superstitions

1

Tennis players are strange people. Have
you noticed how they always ask for
three balls instead of two; how they
bounce the ball the same number of
times before serving, as if any change
from their routine might result in
disaster?

________________ . Goran Ivanisevic,
Wimbledon champion in 2001, was
convinced that if he won a match, he
had to repeat everything he did the
previous day, such as eating the same
food at the same restaurant, talking
to the same people, and watching the
same TV shows. One year this meant
that he had to watch Teletubbies
every morning during his Wimbledon
campaign. “Sometimes it got very
boring/’ he said.
________________ . As we were
watching tennis player Andy Murray
play the fourth set at Wimbledon, my
wife suddenly got up and went to the
kitchen. “He keeps losing games when
I’m in the room/' she said. “If I go out
now, he’ll win.”

________________ , the number
1 female tennis player. When she
was once asked why she had played
so badly at the French Open she
answered, “I didn't tie my shoe laces
right, and I didn't bounce the ball five
times, and I didn’t bring my shower
sandals to the court with me. I didn't
have my extra dress. I just knew it was
fate; it wasn’t going to happen.”

________________ . Last year, a
survey of British soccer supporters
found that 21 percent had a lucky
charm (anything from a scarf
to a lucky coin), while another
questionnaire revealed that
70 percent of Spanish soccer fans
performed pre-match rituals (like
wearing “ lucky” clothes, eating the
same food or drink, or watching
games with the same people).

her, and then remembered my soccer

Love at Exit 19

onya Baker was a frequent commuter from her home in the
suburbs to New York City. One day, when she was driving to
an audition,she came offtheThruway and stopped atthe
tollbooth where Michael Fazio was working. She talked with him as
she paid to go through, and thought he was cute. For the next three
months, they used to exchange a few words
as she handed him the money, and he raised
the barrier to let her pass. “It was mostly
‘What are you doing today? Where are
you going?”' she said. They learned more
about each other, for example that Sonya
loved Puccini and Verdi, while Michael’s
love was the New York Yankees. But their
conversations suddenly came to an end when
Michael changed his working hours. “He used
to work during the day/’ said Sonya, “but he
changed to night shifts/'Although Michael still
looked out for Sonya’s white Toyota Corolla, he
did not see her again for six months.

cone in front of his lane. He thought, “It will be like putting a candle
in a window.” Sonya saw it, and their romance started up again. “I
almost crashed my car on various occasions,” she said, “trying to
cross several lanes to get to his exit/’ Finally, she found the courage
to give Michael a piece of paper with her phone number as she
passed through the toll. Michael called her and for their first date
they went to see the movie Cool Runnings, and then later they
went to an opera, La Boheme, and to a Yankees game.
They are now married and living in Kentucky, where Sonya is a
voice and music professor at Murray State
College and Michael runs an activity center
at a nursing home. It turned out that she had
given him her number just in time. A short
while later, she moved to New Jersey and
stopped usingthe New York State Thruway. “I
might never have seen him again,” she said.

to the day shift, he decided to put a traffic

Heidi arrived almost 25 minutes late for the ceremony,
which was due to begin at 2:45 p.m. Perhaps, as
Carolyn suggested was her habit, she had been in bed
until the last possible minute. She arrived at the church
with security guards holding umbrellas to prevent
onlookers from seeing her, and with her head covered.
This is a well-known tactic for celebrities, but for a
29-year-old secretary it seemed, in the words of one
onlooker, “a bit ridiculous.”
Edward and Carolyn admitted to being disappointed at
not receiving an invitation. They spent the weekend on
vacation with friends. They have had no contact with
the couple since the saga began, and did not even
know the date of the wedding.

You can't be trusted with your own money! You definitely need

was a lucky omen.

Although you understand how to manage your money,

Hi Sofia,

4 Does Sofia think Marisol will get along
with Angela’s family?

I hope you're well.
I'm looking for an au pair to look after Austin and Melissa,
and I remembered your Peruvian friend Marisol, who I met
last summer. She said she might be interested in working
in the US as an au pair, so I thought I would write and ask
her. The thing is, I don't really know her, so before I write
and suggest it, could you tell me a little about her (age,
personality, etc., and what she likes doing) so that I can see
if she would fit in with the family? Please be honest!

d Look at the highlighted expressions we use
to modify adjectives. Put them in the correct
place in the chart.

Hi Angela,
Marisol is one of my best friends, so of course I know her very
well. She's 22, and she just graduated from college with a
degree in economics, but she doesn't have a job yet, and I'm
sure she would be jQt£jr££t£d in going to the US. Her parents
are both doctors, and she has two younger brothers. She gets
along very well with them, and they are a very close family.
Marisol's an intelligent girl and very hardworking. She can
be really shy at first, but when she gets to know you she's
incredibly friendly. She loves children - she often takes care
of her brothers - so she has a lot of experience, and she's
also very l^spf)rj$ahje.

e

In her free time she likes going to the movies, listening to
music, and she's also very good a tfo io g j^g hy-sh e always
has her camera with her. She's really jcicl^p^ru^Qt and happy
to do things on her own, so you won't have to worry about
taking her to places.
The only problem with Marisol is that she's a little fQrggtfulL
she sometimes loses things, like her keys, or her phone.
Also, to be honest her English isn't great, but I'm sure she'll
improve very quickly. I think Austin and Melissa will love her.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you need anything else.
Love,
Sofia

Hi Angela,
I'm really sorry for not writing sooner, but L^m very busy since I
got back!
Thanks for a wonderful six months. I loved being in Colorado, and
I had a great time. I also think my english got a little better... dQrit
you think?
It was so nice to take care of Austin and Melissa. I thought they
were adorable, and I think we had a fantastic time together. I have
really good memories - for example our travel to Denver and the
amusement park there!
I've been a little stressed these last few weeks, because I've
started working at a restaurant, while I look for a full-time job.
a waitress is very hard work, but I can now afford to rent an
apartment with Sofia and two other friends, and I'm saving fQ i
iQ jjtly a car! I’ve also spent a lot of time with my family - my
brothers have changed so much over the past six months!
I've had several jugagg^s from Austin and Melissa since I've
been back! Please tell them from me that I miss them and that
LgttQd them some photos very soon.

Transportation
in New York City

Look at the four forms o f public transportation in New
York City. W hich one do you think is probably...?
• the least expensive
• the healthiest
• the best if you want to see the sights o f New York City
• the safest to use at night
double-decker bus j

subway

The Subway This is the quickest way to g e t 1around
th e city, and there are many subway stations a ll over New
York City. The cheapest way to use the subway is to get a
M etroCard. This is Like a phone card. You p u t m oney on
it, and you can add m ore when you need to. Then you use
it every tim e you g e t 2________ the subway. You can buy
MetroCards at subway stations, newsstands, and even
fro m your employer.
Buses

Read an article from an online magazine for foreign
students about public transportation in New York
City and check your answers to a. Then answer these
questions from memory.
1 What can you use a MetroCard for?
2 What kind o f money do you have to use if you want to
pay cash to ride a New York City bus?
3 W hat’s the difference between a taxi and car service?

O Useful language: transportation in your town
You can buy MetroCards at many places in New York City.
You need a ticket or card before you get on the subway.
(You = people in general)
Comparatives and superlatives:
Buses aren’t as quick as trains.
Riding a bike is the cheapest way to get around.

They can be quicker than th e subway if there
isn't to o much traffic. The easiest way to use th e buses,
Like the subway, is to ju s t use your MetroCard. You can
buy a single-ride ticke t fro m machines 3________ some,
b u t n o t a ll bus stops. You can also pay cash (but
no pennies and no paper money) when you g e t 4________
th e bus. Traveling 5________ a private double-decker
bus is also a good way to see New York City.

Bikes

Bikes are starting to become m ore popular in
New York City, especially 6________ to u rists and people
who want to tra ve l to parts o f the city. Like th e w ate rfro nt
areas, where subways d o n 't usually go. One o f the
newest bike-share programs is called C iti Bike. When you
rent a bike fro m C iti Bike, you get a key th a t Looks Like a
flash drive. You can use the key at any C iti Bike kiosk and
get a bike to ride fo r th e day.

Taxis and Car Service

New York C ity's y e llo w
taxis are expensive, b u t they are com fortable, and the
taxi drivers know shortcuts through the city to get you
to places quickly. You usually t e ll the driver where you
w ant to go when you g e t 7________ th e taxi. Car service
is made up o f norm al cars th a t work fo r a company, and
you have to c a ll them ahead o f tim e to pick you up. They
are m ore expensive than taxis. Taxis and car service are
probably the safest way to tra ve l Late 8________ night.

his happened a few years ago. My husband and I had rented a
house in Galicia fo r a summer vacation. We were going to firs t
drive to Tarragona, to stay fo r a few days with some friends,
and 1 then
drive from Tarragona to Galicia.

T

The first part of the trip was fine. We were using our new GPS for the
first time, and it took us right to the door of our friends' house. Three
days later,2________ we continued our trip, we put in the name of the
small town in Galicia, Nigran, which was our final destination. We started
off, obediently following the instructions, but after a while we realized
th a t3________ driving west toward Lerida, we were going north. In
fact, soon we were very close to Andorra. I was sure we were going in
the wrong direction,4________ my husband wanted to do what the
GPS was telling us - it was his new toy! It was only when we started
seeing mountains that even he admitted this couldn't be the right way.
5________ we stopped, got out an old map, and then turned around!
We had wasted almost two hours going in the wrong direction!
It was an awful trip 6________ as well as getting lost, when we were
almost at our destination we had another problem. We stopped fo r a
coffee, b u t7________ we got back onto the road, we realized that we
had left our dog under the table in the cafe! For the second time that
day we had to turn around and go back. Luckily, the dog was still there!
However,8________ the beginning of our trip was a disaster, we had a
wonderful vacation!

languages, b u t have d iffe re n t meanings.
S e n s ib le looks ve ry similar to sensible in Spanish and
French, b u t in fa c t in English it means someone w ho has
common sense and is practical. The Spanish / French
word sensible tra n sla te s as s e n s it iv e in English (to
describe a person who is easily hurt).
S y m p a t h e t ic does n o t mean th e same as s empatik
