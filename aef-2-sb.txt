Joe 28, a flight attendant
Last October, I went on vacation to Thailand
for two weeks with my girlfriend, Mia.
The vacation began well. We spent two
days in Bangkok and saw the Floating
Market and the Royal Pala ce. But things
went wrong when we left Bangkok. I
wanted to stay in hostels, which were
basic but clean, but Mia said they were
too uncomfortable. So we stayed in very
expensive hotels. I wanted to experience
the local atmosphere, but Mia just wanted to
go shopping.1 thought I knew Mia well, but you don't know a persa n until
you travel with him or her.lt was awful! We argued about everything .
For our last four days we went to Ko Chang, a beautiful istand. It was
like being in paradise. The weather was beautiful and the beaches were
wonderful, but we just sunbathed without speaking. We spent our last night
back in Bangkok, and we met some travelers from Australia. They were really
friendly, and Mia started flirting with one of the boys. That was the end.
you don't know a When we arrived at O'Hare International
person until you Airportthe next day. we decided to break up.

"

l' d love to 90 back
to Costa Rica one
day... but without
Linda. "

Last spring, my best friend Isabelle and
I booked a vacation in Costa Rica. We rented
a small house for a week with a fantastic view
of the ocean. At the last minute another friend,
Linda, asked if she could come, too. We felt sorry for her because she had
problems with her boyfriend, so we said yeso

Costa Rica was magical and the weather was perfect, but the vacation was
a disaster for one simple reason: linda was so cheap! 5he has a good job so
she's not poor, but she just didn't want to pay for anything. When we went
sightseeing, she didn't want to go on any cruises or do any nature
activities that cost money. When we went on a zipline tour, she
complained that it was too expensive. When we went to have
lunch or dinner, she always wanted to go to cheap restaurants
or she bought a sandwich and ate it in the house. But the night
I invited her and Isabel le out on my birthday, she chose the
most expensive things on the menu! The worst thing was that
although Isabelle and I paid for the house,linda never once
bought us a coffee or a snack.
I'd lave to go back to Costa Rica one day... but without Linda.

he first time 1 noticed this phenomenon was a few years
ago, in Sto Peter's Basilica in Rome - a crowd of people
standing around Michelangelo's Pieta, taking photos with
their cameras and cell phones. Then last week 1 saw it again
at the Museum of Modern Art (the MOMA) in New York City.
At first , 1 wasn't too worried when 1 saw people photographing
the paintings. It was a Iiule irritating, but that was all. It didn't
make me angry. Then the sad truth hit me. Most of the people
were taking photos without looking at the paintings themselves.
People were pushing me, not because they were trying to get
a better view ofthe art, but because they wanted to make sure
that no one blocked their photo. Was ir possible thar maybe they
were taking the photos so that they could admire the paintings
better when they got home? This was very improbable. They
were not there to see the paintings, but to take photos to prove
that they had been there.

T

Then ir got worse. Now people were taking photos oftheir
partners or fr iends who were posing next to, or in front of sorne
of the most famous paintings. Neither the photographers nor
the person they were photographing had looked at the art itself,
although 1 saw that sometimes they read the label , to make sure
that the artist really was famous. At least nobody asked me to
take a picture of them together, smiling in front of a Picasso!

New words are created in many different ways. We can
make a new word by combining two words, like gastropub
(gastronomy + pub) or emoticon (emotion + icon).
Sometimes we put two words together in a new way, for
example, road rage or boy toy.
We also find that nouns can change into verbs . Take the
word texto Text was always a noun (from about 1369,
according to the DED), but it is now very common as a
verb, to text somebody. Dther new words already existed,
but with a different meaning. For example, tweet was the
noise that a bird makes, but now we use it more often (as a
verb or a noun) for a message that people put on the social
networking site Twitter.
Another way in which we make new words is by
"adopting" words from foreign languages, like barista or
latte (imported from Italian when coffee shops beca me
really popular in the US in the 1990s).
A lot of new words come from the names of brands or
companies, for example, we play music on an iPod and we
google information. We also need more general wo rds to
describe new technology or new gadgets: Wi-Fi, ringtone,
and smartphone are some recent examples.
The invention of new words is not a new phenomenon.
The word brunch (breakfast + lunch) first appeared in
1896, newspaper (news + paper) in 1667, and English
s peakers started to use the word cafe (from French) in
the late 19th century. The difference now is how quickly
new words and expressions enter the language and how
quickly we start to use and understand them .

su rve y of 5,000 adults has shown that one person in
four invents details about their weekend beca use they

A

want to impress their friends. When they are asked,

5

"Did you have a good weekend?" they don't like to say that
they just stayed at home and watched TV beca use it sounds
boring. So they invent the details. The most common lie that
people tald was "1 went out on Saturday night," when really
they didn't go anywhere. Other common lies were "1 had a
romanti c dinner," "1 went to a party," and "1 went away for

10

the weekend,"
In fact, in the survey, 30% of people who answered the
questions sa id that they spent their weekend sleeping or
resting because they were so tired at the end of the week .

15

20

Another 30% said that they needed to work or study on
the weekend. Psychologist Corinne Sweet says that people
often don't tell the truth about their weekend "beca use we
don't want to feel that everyone else is having a better time
than us, if we have had a boring weekend doing housework,
paperwork, or just resting after a tiri ng week at work ." She also
believes that networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter
may be encouraging us to invent details about our social lives.
"People can create an illusion of who they wa nt to be and the
life they want to live," says Corinne, "and of course they want
that life to seem exciting."

Do people teLL you that yo u t al k

PeopLe aren't as patient as they were in the past. If the elevator takes
more than 15 seconds to arrive, people get very impatient beeause
they think they're wasting time. 11'5 exactly the same when an
Internet page does not open immediateLy.

2 Do you get impatient when other
peopLe are t aLking?

3 Are you the first person to finish at
meaLtimes?

Written communication on the Internet is getting shorter and shorter
and using more and more abbreviations, like BRB (be right back ) or NP
(no probLem ). Twitter only aLLows you to use 140 characters, and now a
new social networking site has a limit of just ten words.

peopLe who are waLking more slowLy?

5 Do yo u get irritabLe if you sit for an hou r

Even in our free time we do things in a hurry. Twenty years ago when

COFFEE We all know t hat a cup of coffee helps to wake you
up in t he mo rn ing, but several studies show that drinki ng coffee
helps to prevent some illnesses like diabetes and Parkinson's
disease. Experts say that you ca n safely dri nk three cups of
espresso during the day, but if you drink too much coffee it can
make you fee l anxious or keep you awake at night.

SUN LlGHT Spending a long time in t he sun 15 dangerous
and ca n give you ski n cancer. But o n the ot her ha nd, not
spendi ng enough time in the su n is also bad for you because
sun light hel ps us to produce vitamin D. This vitam in is important
for strong bones and a healthy immu ne system, and ir also makes
people feel happier. Nowadays, ma ny people don't get enough
sun light beca use rhey wear sunscreen all rhe time, especially on
their faces. However, don't spend too long in t he sun - 15 m inutes
a day w ithout sunscreen is a healthy arnount, and not at midday.

COMPUTER GAMES You probably worry about how
much time you or your childre n waste playing computer games.
But in fact sorne studies show t hat these games can help us learn
important ski lis. Ir seems that computer games st imu late rhe
brai n and that people who ofte n play them are probably bet ter
at solving problems and making qu ick decisio ns, But do n't
spend too many hours in front of the compu ter - not
more than about two hours a day.

Can music really make you run faster?
ostas Karageorghis, a sports psychologist, ca lis music
"sport's legal drug." He says that exercising with music can
improve athletic performance by 15 percent. The music must
be carefully chosen so that the tempo or "beat~ is synchronized
with the exercise you are doing. According to Professor
Karageorghis, music also makes you feelless pain and makes an
exercise session less boring and more enjoyable.
Gym chain, Fitness First, recognizes the importan ce of music
to workouts and plays music in all its clubs. The most popular
song for male gym members is 5urvivor's Eye 01 the Tiger, while
wo men love Abba's Dancing Queen.
(

Music wor ks well with weightlifting, and other repetitive
actions, but it can also help with running. The best example
of this is Haile Gebreselassie, perhaps the world's greatest
distance runner, who used the techno-pop so ng Scotmon as a
metronome when he broke the world 2,000 meter record. But
if music was so important to Gebreselassie, why do other top
runners never race with headphones?
Karageorghis says "Research has shown that for most top
athletes music is less effective. Elite athletes focus more on
their bodies, and less on outside stimuli like music.~ So although
music can help amateur runners run faster and further, most
top athletes prefer silence.
I decided to try running with music myself.1 was going to run a

half marathon, and a sports doctor gave me the perfect playlist
of songs for running. When I did the race.1 found that some of
the tracks.like Von Kleet's Walking on Me, made running easier.
Others made me want to throw away the mp3 player. When I
crossed the line, I had beaten my previous personal best by one
minute. but was it because of the music? To be honest, I fe lt it
was probably beca use of the extra training.

I taok a one-month intensive course in Spanish at a

example the verbs in Spanish change for each person, and
that means you have to learn a lot of different endings.
My biggest problem was the pronunciation.1 found it
very difficult to pronounce some letters in Spanish,

my smartphone, and Ilistened and repeated them again

When my course ended, I went to San Juan, Puerto Rico

for each test and then a final score for everything.

The normal treatment for people with strong
phobia s is so me kind of exposure therapy. The
most commonly used exposure therapy involve s
gradually exposing people to the object or situation
that produces the fear. For example, ifyou have a
denti st phobia, you might first sit in the waiting

then sit in the denti st's chair. These exposures are

ifeguard Rob Howes, his daughter Niccy, 15, Karina Cooper, 15,
and Helen Slade, 16, were swimming over 300 feet out to sea
at Ocean Beach in New Zealand when suddenly seven dolphins
swam towa rd them.

L

"They were behaving really we irdly," Mr. Howes sa id, "swimming
in circles around us, and hitting the water with their tails." One
dolphin swam toward Mr. Howes and Helen, who were about
65 feet away from the other two, and was trying to push them
toward the other two girls.
"Then suddenly I saw another huge fish swimming around me
and Helen," said Mr. Howes.lt was in fact a 9 foot-Iong great
white shark.
"It was only about six feet away from us," he said. At that point,
he realized that the dolphins ~were trying to herd the four of
us together to protect us."
The shark then went toward the other two girls. Mr. Howes was
terrified, especially beca use one of the swimmers was his daughter.
But the dolphins pushed the four swimmers back together and
circled around them for another 40 minutes. Mr. Howes decided
not to tell the three girls a shark was sharing the water with them.
Fortunately, the shark finally swam away, and the swimmers all
reached the beach safely.
"1 swim with dolphins perhaps three or four times ayear, and
I have never seen them behave like that," said Mr. Howes.
However, dolphin expert Ingrid Visser said that there have been
other reports from around the world about dolphins protecting
swimmers. She said that, in this case, the dolphins probably sensed
the humans were in danger and took action to protect them.

The Final Countdown .n

he hardest les son to learn in sports is how to
lose with dignity, without blaming your defeat
on the referees or refusing to shalce hands with
your opponent. Here are some famous moments
when losing was just too hard ...

T

In 1981 at Wimbledon a young John McEnroe was
serving. The umpire said that his serve was l _ _~
but McEnroe t hought it was 2
. He beca me
furious and shouted UYou CANNOT be serious!" at the
umpire. He also called the umpire "an incompetent fool!"
In the 2003 Track. and Field World Championships the
IDO-meter runner, Jan Drummond, was disq ualified for
a false start. Drummond lay 3
on the track and
began to cry. Two hours later his coach told journalists:
"He's still crying. We're making him drink water because
he's becoming dehydrated."
In the 1982 German Grand Prix Nelson Piquet was
w inning the race. He was trying to pass Eliseo Salazar
(who was last in the race), but Sa lazar didn't let him go
4
him, and Piquet crashed into Salazar. Piquet
jumped 5
his ca r and started trying to hit and
kick Salazar (without much success!).
South Korean soccer player Ahn Jung-Hwan scored
the goa l that sent Italy 6
the 2002 World Cup
when they beat them 2-1. But Jung-Hwa n also played
for the Italian soccer club Perugia . After the match
the president of the club, Luciano Gaucci, announced
that the player's contract wo uld not be rene wed. "That
gentleman w ill never set foot in Perugia again," Gaucci
said. "1 have no intention of paying a salary to somebody
who has ruined Italian soccer." Gaucci later apologized,
but Ahn Jung-Hwan left the club and never went back to
an Italian club.
When England won the Rugby
World Cup in 2003 by beating
Australia in the last minute of
the match , the Australian Prime
minister, John Howa rd , was so
angry that in the medals cere mony
he almost threw the meda ls at the
English players . His behavior was
described by a journalist as being
uLike an unhappy five-year-old at a
birthday party w ho starts throwing
toys around."

What sociallife? I certainly can't go out for a wild night during the
week, but I'm lucky because a lot of my closest friends live near me,
so lean see them in the evenings and still go to bed early.

Sometimes I think I would like to have more normal
working hours, but llave my job so much that
I'd never want to give it up. The buzz of
being "Iive" on the radio early in the morning
as people start their days is really wonderful.

Dayton, Ohio. By coincidence, both boys were named ~Jim"
by their new parents. When Hm Lewis was six years old,

he was thirty-nine, he decided to find and contact his
brother. Six weeks later, he met Hm Springer in a cafe in

I

were amazed when they saw a dog
getting off a train and walking on it5
own toward the airport terminal. They
caught the dog and took it to the police.
Thanks to a microchip in its neck,
they discovered that its name was
Diesel and that it belonged to a woman
named Sarah Chapman, who lived in
London, 31 miles away. Sarah had
gone on vacation for a few days and
had left Diesel with some friends.
It had then
gotten on a train and had traveled
31 miles to Stansted Airport,
changing trains on the way. Sarah
said: "I'm sure Diesel went to the

Gossip might be good for you
We all enjoy gossiping about people we know,
although sometimes we might feel guilty
about it afterward. However, new research
shows that gossiping might be good for uso
Professor McAndrew, a professor of psychology,
believes that gosslping is in our genes, and we feel
pleasure when we share interesting information.
McAndrew says that gossiping is a sociaL skilL,
and we need to learn to do it weLL. According
to the professor, gossip can be a positive thing
when peopLe use it to build connections with
other peopLe in their sociaL group. But it can be
a negatlve thing when somebody gossips about
another person only to make themselves feeL
more important in the group.

hen Suzanne met Alistair Cotto n at a sw i mming pool
in 1995, t hey were amazed t o discover t hat they
both suffered from the same extremely rare heart
condit ion. They started going out together and fe ll in love,
but seve ral months later, they discovered an even bigger
coinc idence.
Almos t twenty years ear lier whe n they we re chi ldren
(Suzanne was seven and Ali stai r was fourteen), they had
both had a lifesaving heart operat ion in the same hospital,
on the same day, performed by the same heart surgeon.
After their operations, they had spen t several days
recovering in the same hospital ward (although they
have no memo ries of seeing or speaking to each ot her.)
They certa i nly had no idea that t wen t y years later t hey
would meet and fall in love with the chi ld in the next bed.
Suzanne, now 43, sald, "We were very shocked by the
coincldence. We were obv iously destined to be toget her."
Alistair con t inued to have difficulties with his heart, and he
had to have another major heart operation. As soon as he
woke up after the operatio n, he proposed to Suza nne, and
the cou ple got married in 2002.
The following year, Suzanne beca me pregnant, and baby
Hannah was born i n 2004 and is now a happy, healthy child
who shows no signs of having inherited any heart prob lems
from her parents. Suzanne said , "Many heart patie nts can't
have ch il dren or the ir ch ildre n are born wit h heart problems
themse lves, so for our amazing st ory to have such a happy
ending is just won derful."

Landan
The photo test
I was near Charring Cross station. I stopped aman who was walking
pretty slowly down the street, and I said, "Excuse me, could you
take my photo?" The man said, "No, no, no time for that," and just
continued walking. Then I asked a business man in a gray suit who
was walking toward the train station. He took one photo, but when I
asked him to take another one, he walked away quickly.

The shopping test
I went to a souvenir store on Oxford Street, and I bought a key ring
and a red bus. The red bus was very expensive. The total price was
forty pounds. I gave the man a hundred pounds. He gave me sixty
pounds back.
The accident test
For this test, I went down into the Tube (the London Underground). As I
went down the stairs, I fell down and sat on the floor. Aman immediately
stopped and looked down at me. I thought he was going to help me, but
he didn't- he just said, "Why don't you look where you're going?"

5 The answer is c. lf a jellyfish stings you, you shouLd cLean the sting
with vinegar beca use this stops the poison.lfyou don't have any
vinegar, use ocean water. But don 't use fresh water, for example
water from a tap or mineraL water, beca use this will make the sting
hurt more. And you shouLdn't rub the sting because this will make
it worse, too. Afteryou have washed the sting,you should clean
off any bits of tentacLes that are on your skin. And take a pain killer!
6 The answer is a, If you are near the shore and the shark is not too
cLose, you can probabLy swim to the shore without attracting its
attention. For this reason it is important to swim smoothLy and
not spLash or make sudden movements. Keeping still is dangerous
because if the shark swims inyour direction, it will see you and it
wiLL attack you. Don't shout because shouting will provoke the
shark and it will attack you.

DO YOU AGREE?
Every time I turn on the television , I'm sure to find a sports
show on one 01 the ehan nels. II I ehange ehannels, there
will probably be a sports show or a sports report on other
channels, too, especially on the weekend . llnmyopinion there

reasons .

Seeondly, the sports shows on TV are not on ly the importan t

Mrlllld Mrs Clllrka/Ul Pere)' is by artist David
Hockney, and ir's considered to be one of rhe
grearesl Brirish pai nrings of rhe 20rh eentury. Ir
was pai lIted in 1971. and it 's a port rail of I wo ofhis
friends , Ossie Clark and his wife Celia, and Iheir cal
Perey. Ossie Clark and Celia were fashion designers,
and rhey had a ver)' successful clorhes store in
London.ln Ihe 1960s. Ihey dressed a loroflhe
famous pop starsoflhe lime, includingThe Rollillg
Stones Jnd Eric Clapton.
Hockney paimed Ossie and Celia a few monrhs
afrer rhe)' gor married in rheir aparrmenr ar Non ing
H ill in London. He pai nred rhem in rhei r bedroorn
because he Ji ked 1he lighr rhere, and on rhe wall on
rhe lefr oflhe windowyou can see one ofhis own
paimings.
Mr aud Mrs Cia rk a,¡d Perey is a ve ry big paiming.
approximalely 9 feel , 10 inches wide and 6 fee l ,

in faet she was expect ing a baby al rhar 1ime. Her

his feet into Ihe rugo This was because Hockney had
a lot of problellls pai nt ing h is feet. He jllst could n't

Hockne)' said t hat h is aim with Ihis pai nt ing was
to painl the relalionship belween the two people.
Tradit ionally, when a pai Iller paints a married
cOllple the woman issill ing down and Ihe man is
standing up. In Ihis pail1l ing, Ihe man is sitt ing and
the woman is standing. Usually in a painting Ihe

Ihey are separated by a big open wi ndow whieh

118

seems rhar Hockney didn't 1hi n k Ihar I heir marriage
was going lO be ver)' happy, and in fact, Ihe couplc
gOl divorced four years laler.
Celia often posed asa model for Hockney, but

Interviewer Today we talk to Laurel Rerce. who's
wriring a book abom how to live morr slowly. She's
going to give liS fivr useful tips.
Laurel My firsr cip is something that is very
si mple 10 sa)', bUl more difficulr tO do in pracrice.
Whatever you're doi ng, just try ro slow down and
enjoy il. 1f you're walking sornewherr, tr)' to ",alk
more slowly; if you are driving, make yOllrself
drive more slowly. Ir doesn'r mattrr what you are
doing, cooking, raking a shower, exercisi ng i n rhe
gym, jusI slow down and really enjoy Ihe momenr.
\Ve all try to do toO many rhings that we jusrdon't
have cime foro So my second [ip is make a list of
the rhree rhi ngs rhar are mosr i mportant for yOl! your prioriries inlife. T hen when you've made
)'our 11st make sure l hat you spend time doing
Ihose I h ings. Imagine for examp!c I hal your
duee rhillgs are yOllr family, reading, and playing
sports. Then make sure rhar you spend enough
ti me wit h your family, I hal )'011 have space in )'our
li fe for reading, and I hal you have lime la play
SPOrts. And forgel aboul Ir)'ing lO do olher Ihings
thal you don'r have rime foro
Tip lIumber ¡hree is don'l try 10 do I wo I hi ngs
al ¡he same lime, The worsl Ih iug you can do is
lIlultitask. So for example, don 't read your emai 1
while you are ralking to a friend on the phone.
1f you do t har. you aren't really focusing on your
email or your friend and yotl aren 'l going \'O feel
very relaxed eitlter.
Tip numbrr four is ver)' simple: once a day, evrry
day, sil down and do nothing for halfan hour.
For example . go to a cafe and sit oUTside, or go to
a park and sil on a bench, Turn o(fyour phone so
thal nobody can contactyou. and then JUSt sir and
watcll rhr world go by. This will rrally help you to
slowdown.
OK. My fifth and final rip. One ofthe most
relaxing rhillgs you can do is ro be lIear water or
even better. to be on warer. So if youlivr near a
lake or river, go and sil by rhe ri ver, or go boati ng.

If yo u live nea r t he ocean . go alld sit 011 Ihe beach .
Rela x alld lisIen 10 Ihe sourld o f lile wind alld Ihe
wate r. You will feel yOIlT OOdy a nd mind slowing
down as rhe Ini rlUles go pasT.
