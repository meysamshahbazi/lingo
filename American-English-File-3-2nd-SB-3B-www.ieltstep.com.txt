You are standing in the place where...
Highclere Castle n ear Newbury in Berkshire, UK
he castle has b een ' owned by the Carnarvon family since 1679, and the
Earl and Countess Carnarvon currently live there. In 2010, movie director
Julian Fellowes, a close friend of the family, was planning a new TV series
about an aristocratic family and their servants during the early 20th century.
While he was staying at Highclere Castle, he realized that it would be the
perfect place to set his historical drama, and the castle w as2___________ into
Downton Abbey, the home of the fictional Crawley family. The series was a
huge success, and it has been sold all over the world. Both the interior and
exterior scenes were shot in and around the castle itself.

Cortlandt Alley

T

New York City, USA

In the second season of the TV series, the castle is used as a hospital during
the First World War. These scenes a re 3___________ on a real-life event. In 1914,
Lady Almina Carnarvon allowed soldiers who had been wounded to be taken
care of in the castle.

n Hollywood’s version of New York City, the giant
metropolis is full of secret alleys where crimes take
place, and criminals are chased by the police. In fact,
there are hardly any alleys in New York today at all. Ont
of the few remaining ones, Cortlandt Alley, has been
2___________ for almost all the alley scenes in movies
and TV series that are set in New York City. Movies with
scenes that were shot there include Crocodile Dundee
and Men in Black 3, and TV series like Blue Bloods,
Boardwalk Empire, NYPD Blue, and Law & Order.

Highclere Castle and gardens are open to the public during
the Easter holidays and during the summer—from July to
September. It is also open on many Sundays and holidays
from 10:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Visit the Egyptian Gallery,
which contains many objects brought back from his travels
by I.ady Almina’s husband,
the fifth Earl of Carnarvon,
who famously discovered
t he tomb of the young
Pharaoh Tutankhamun.

Thousands of tourists want to b e 5___________
in Cortlandt Alley. It is on the edge of Chinatown,
in Manhat tan, between Franklin Street and Canal
Street. In fact, it is a perfectly safe place to visit. In real
life, it is n o t6___________by gangsters, but is the home
for perfectly respectable
businesses such as the New

Casa Loma

c

Toronto, Canada
his Gothic Revival style building, with a
spectacular tower, w as7___________ by
Canadian architect E.J. Lennox. The original
owner, Sir Henry Mill Pellatt spent $3.5 million
and hired 300 workers to construct the building.
After three years, the castle was finally completed
in 1914. Unfortunately, in 1933, ihe city of Toronto
seized Casa Loma from Pellatt for nonpayment
o f taxes. After several years of neglect, the castle
was scheduled for demolition, but it was saved by
the Kiwanis Club—a service club that helps the
homeless, the hungry, and other disadvantaged
people. The club still holds meetings there today!
During World War II, equipment designed to find
underwater enemy boats was made in the castle.
Because of its unusual look, the castle has been
used as a location in several well-known movies
such as X-Men, Chicago, and Scott Pilgrim vs.
the World. In addition, author Eric Wilson was

Yes appearance matters.

hen S u sa n Boyle first walked onto the stage
of the Britain's Got Talent T V show, people
im m ediately thought that she looked like a
47 -year-old single woman who lived alone with
her cat (which in fact she was). N obody thought for a minute
that she had a chance of d o ing well on the show, or could
ever become a star. But when she opened her mouth and
started sin g in g I Dreamed a Dream,
from the m usical Les Miserables,
everybody w as amazed. After the
video of her performance went
viral, journalists started talking
about how w rong it is to stereotype
people into categories, and how we
should learn, once and for all, “not to
judge a book by its cover.”

W

m ost stereotypes are linked to judging whether a person
looks dangerous or not. “In prehistoric times, it was
important to stay away from people who looked aggressive
and dominant,” she said.

O ne reason why our brains persist in u sin g stereotypes,
experts say, is that often they give u s generally accurate
information, even if all the details aren’t right.
Ms. Boyle’s appearance, for example,
accurately told u s a lot about her,
including her socioeconom ic level
and lack of worldly experience.
People’s enthusiasm for Susa n
Boyle, and for other underdogs who
end up winning, is unlikely to
stop us from stereotyping
people. T h is may be one
of the reasons why,
although Ms. Boyle
expressed the
hope that
“m aybe this
could teach
them a
lesson, or set
an example,”
she did begin
to change
her appearance,
w earing makeup,
dyin g her gray hair,
and appearing in more
stylish clothing.

But social scientists say that
there are reasons why we
judge people based on how
they look. O n a very basic
level, judging people by
their appearance m eans
putting them quickly into
categories. In the past,
being able to do this was
vitally important, and
hum ans developed the
ability to judge other
people in seconds.
Su sa n Fiske, a professor
of psychology and
neuroscience at
Princeton University,
said that traditionally,

a young

Generally, it is considered bad luck to wish someone “good
luck” in a theater. Before a performance, it is traditional for
the cast to get together and prevent bad luck by wishing each
other bad luck. English actors used to say to each other “I hope
you break a leg,” and even today actors and musicians often
say "break a leg” to each other instead of “good luck" before
they go on stage.

NOT W ITHOUT A N AUDIENCE
it is considered bad luck to complete a performance of a play
when there is no audience. For this reason actors never say
the last line of a play during rehearsals, or some production
companies allow a limited number of people (usually friends,
family, and reviewers) to attend the dress rehearsals.

WHISTLING
It is considered bad luck for an actor to whistle on or off
stage. Original stage crews were often hired from ships
that were in port, and whose sailors were temporarily
unemployed. These sailors, as they did on ships, often used
special whistles to communicate scene changes to each
other. If an actor whistled, this could confuse the sailors into
changing the set or scenery at the wrong time.

A lot of people wonder why so many Chinese
children are math geniuses and musical prodigies.
Amy Chua explains why in her book Battle Hymn
of the Tiger Mother. It is a book that caused great
controversy among parents when it was first
published.2_________________ , Chua married
a man who she met at Harvard University, and
when their two daughters were born she was
determined that they would be as successful as
she was.

d R ead th ree resp o n ses th a t w ere posted a fte r th e article
w as published. D o you agree w ith any o f them ?

Wow, w hat a different way o f looking a t how to learn!
Amy Chua certainly shows that strict discipline works.
But personally I think that being positive and encouraging
children is better than being so strict.
At 13 Sophia played a piano solo at Carnegie Hall in New
York City, and at 12, Lulu a violinist, was the leader of a
prestigious orchestra for young people. Chua chose math
and music for her daughters, but it seems that they could
have excelled in anything. 4_________________________ .

I disagree with the idea that children on their own never
want to work. My son was motivated by him self to succeed
in music. I f having strict and pushy parents is w hat it takes
to be a child prodigy, then I fe e l sorry fo r the child. Yes, they
might be very successful, but at w hat cost? W hat is the rest
o f their life going to be like?

Eventually Chua realized that she was pushing her daughters
too hard. Lulu had always rebelled the most, and when she
was 13 she refused to cooperate at all. After a series of
violent arguments, Chua decided to give her daughters a
little more freedom, and Lulu immediately gave up violin
lessons and took up tennis.5___________________ .

I agree that no m atter w hat we do in life, hard work is
required to be successful. T h at’s a great lesson to learn.
BUT, it should be accom panied by love and respect fo r
the child.

Many people have been shocked by the book.
6___________________ . She once sent her daughter Lulu,
aged three, into the yard without her coat when it was 21°F
because she had behaved badly at her first piano lesson.
However, the girls do not seem to resent their mother.
Sophia said that she herself chose to accept the system,
and after the book was published, she wrote an article
defending her mother. Lulu says that although she no longer
wants to be a violinist, she still loves playing the violin.
7___________________ . Sophia is
now studying law at Harvard, and
Lulu is doing well in high school
and winning tennis trophies.
Interestingly Chua, who was brought
up in a family of four girls, has no
idea whether she could apply her
Chinese parenting system to boys.

a w aitress cry. He loves co m p lain in g properly and in writing.
O ver the last 20 years, he has written over 5,000 letters of complaint.
H is su c c e sse s include refunded vacations, cou ntless free m eals, and
com plim entary theater tickets.

The King of C
Complainers

S o how has he achieved th is? “Scream ing
and sho uting is a complete waste of time and
is usually directed at a person w ho is not in
a position to do anything," he says. “I like to
write a polite letter to the company. People
w on’t want to help you if you are aggressive.
They respond much better to good manners.”
It all started many years ago, on a boring train trip home to W est London.
The train passed by a cookie factory, and the sm ell of the cookies made
Clive feel hungry. He wrote a letter to the m anaging director to complain,
in a hum orous way, about the fum es com in g through the train window.
The result? So m e free packages of cookies. But since then there have
been more se riou s victories as well. On one occasion he m anaged to get a
Volksw agen Golf G T I within 24 hours for a friend w ho had been
com plaining for alm ost a year (without any success) about
his faulty vehicle. On another occasion he got a travel
agent to refund the cost of a vacation after C live’s wife
Bettina broke her leg when she slipped in a puddle of
water in their vacation apartm ent in Spain.
These days, there is alm ost nothing he w on’t com plain
about. After Clive w as served m oldy straw berries on a
British A irw ays flight, he used a courier service to send
the fruit to the airline’s chief executive. To compensate, BA
invited his daughters, Nina and Zoe, to Heathrow to personally
inspect the airline’s catering facilities. “I just can’t bear bad service,” sa y s
Clive. “We have a right to good service, and should expect it and demand
it. In fact, what irritates me more than anything is that, unlike Am ericans,
we British are hopeless at com plaining.”
S o how do Bettina, his wife, and daughters Nina, 22 , Zoe, 18 , and 12-yearold son Joe cope with living with one of the w orld’s bigge st com plainer?
Surely he m ust be a nightm are to live w ith? H as he ever
asked Bettina to explain why a meal she made is
badly coo ked? “Oh, no, of course not,” sa y s
Clive. It seem s there are som e th ings
even he know s you should never
com plain about!

Say the words aloud, and th en w rite them in the co rrect colum n.

Never sho ut and swear - it achieves
nothing. D o n ’t spoil your meal or your
vacation by getting into an argum ent
with a waiter or custom er service call
center operator. Make a mental note
of the circum stances and write a
letter later.

D o n ’t send emails, or standard, printedout com plaints forms. Com panies
may not read these, but they probably
will read a letter. And unless you are
particularly fond of Vivaldi, don’t waste
your time calling a custom er com plaint
line! Your letter should be short and
to the point, and should fit on one side
of an 8 1/2" by ı ı " sheet of paper.
And type it. Reading other people’s

o far, the Sharks have agreed
to invest over $6.2 million in
products, companies, and ideas
presented on Shark Tank. They were
very happy with their investment
inTravis Perry, a guitar player from
Alabama who had the idea for Chord
Buddy - a device that helps people
learn to play the guitar. He came into the Tank with som e guitars
that had the device attached to them. Shark, Robert Herjavec
immediately sensed an opportunity in the charismatic Travis
and agreed to invest $125,000 in his product. A year later, Chord
Buddy has made over $ 1.5 million in sales and has John Rich - a
fam ous country singer - representing the product. Travis is now
running an impressive and profitable company.

hark Tank is a US T V show, with similar
versions in many different countries. O n
the U S show, contestants have about ten
minutes to present their business ideas to five
very successful businesspeople. These people
are nicknamed the "Sharks," and the intimidating
room where they meet the contestants is the
"Tank" (the sharks' home). The Sharks, who are
often multimillionaires, are prepared to invest
m oney in any business that they believe might
be a success. In return, they take a share of the
profits. The contestants are usually entrepreneurs,
product designers, or people with a new idea for
a service. After the contestants have made their
presentations, the Sharks ask them questions
about the product and its possible market, and
then say if they are prepared to invest or not. If they
are not convinced by the presentation, they say the
dreaded words "I'm out.”

usie Taylor wanted the Sharks to invest in her high-tech baby
bib company. The bibs are made from high-quality materials
that don't stain. N obody was enthusiastic, and the
. Sharks rejected her idea. But Susie hasn’t given
up. Since appearing on the TV show, orders for
Susie's bibs increased and she has been contacted
by other investors. And that is what makes a real
entrepreneur—he or she never gives up. If the
ı Sharks invest in him or her, there is a chance he
or she will be successful. But if they leave
the Tank empty-handed, the determination
to make it on their own is as great as ever.

nd of course, the Sharks don't always
get it right. C o o k Shawn Davis’s product,
gourm et shrimp burgers, was rejected. O ne Shark said, "I'll buy the
product, but I don't really know the food business well enough
to make the product successful.” Another Shark said, "I just don't
like shrimp at all, so based on that,
[j
I’m out." A third shark
said getting shrimp
and keeping it cold
makes the product
too expensive for the
public to buy. Today,
Davis’s company is
worth $6 million, and
his shrimp burgers are
sold in supermarkets
across the US!

1 A m ber s a y s _______is mixed so a mixed school is better.

When I was growing up, all I wanted to be was an artist.
When I got to high school and could choose what classes
to take, I took every art class that was available. Painting,
drawing, photography, you name it - I took the class.

a real in teraction

c the world o f business
2 M ax likes shopping online b ecau se_______ .
a there is m ore availability o f products
b he doesn’t like looking at a variety o f products
c he is extroverted

Then I took a chemistry class. I LOVED it. It was fun! And I
was good at it. I started thinking: wouldn’t I make more money
if I went into the sciences instead of being a starving artist?
So I threw away the art school applications and went to study
chemistry. College was fun, and when I graduated with my
chemistry degree, I went to graduate school in Washington,
D.C. to do a PhD program in chemistry! It was O K to start
with, but after the first year, I was completely depressed. I
hated the program. It was dry and boring. But I didn’t know
what to do about it.

Adapted from workawesome.com

So I quit. I spent the next month feeling bad about my failure,
unsure what to do next. Finally, I went to an employment
agency to get a job. Something - anything - that would pay
money.
I got a temporary job filling envelopes at an NGO. One day
they needed some graphic design and I volunteered. This
was the major turning point in my career. Over the next few
months, they gave me more and more design work. What
began as a temporary job turned into a permanent job. I was
finally doing something I loved, and I was making money
doing it.
It’s been difficult at times, but I really love my job. Believe
me, it is FAR more important that you are happy and get to
do what you are passionate about every day and get paid
less for it, than to dread getting up in the morning because
you dislike what you do.

I w as livin g in a s tu d e n t fla t in N o r t h L o n d o n , w hen the
police knocked o n my d o o r one night. I thought it w as because I

But then I w ondered if it w as som ething to do with m y mother,
w h o I knew w asn’t very well. There w as no phone in the flat and
this w as before the days of mobile phones, so I ran dow n to the
nearest phone box and phoned my dad in Leeds, in the north of
England. H e told me that my m um w as very ill in hospital and that
I should go hom e as soo n as I could.
W h e n I got to the station I found that I’d missed the last train
to Leeds. There w as a train to Peterborough, from w here som e
local trains w ent to Leeds, but I w ould miss the connection by
about 20 minutes. I decided to get the Peterborough train - I was
so desperate to get hom e that I thought maybe I could hitchhike
from Peterborough.
“Tickets, please.” I looked up and saw the ticket inspector. H e
could see from my eyes that I’d been crying. “A r e you O K ? ”
he asked. “O f course I’m O K , ” I said. “You look awful,” he
continued. “Is there anything I can d o ?” “You could go away,” I
said rudely.

1 Q

The students
I was living in Korea at the time,
teaching English. I had to leave
the country and return again
because of problems with my
visa, so I booked a ferry to
Fukuoka in Japan. I intended
to change some South Korean
money into Japanese yen when
I got there, but when I arrived, I discovered it was a holiday in
Japan and all the banks were closed. I didn’t have a credit card, so
I walked from the ferry terminal toward the town wondering what I
was going to do without any Japanese money. I was feeling lonely
and depressed when suddenly I heard a young couple speaking
French. I asked them if they spoke any English, and they told me (in
good English) that they were Belgian students. When I explained
my problem, they immediately offered to take me around the city
and look for somewhere where I could change money. They paid
for my bus ticket, and they took me to several places, and in the
end, we found a hotel where I was able to change my cash. They
then invited me to join them and their friends for the evening. I had a
fantastic night and have never forgotten how they changed all their
plans just to help a stranger. - Karina

The angel
It was a cold Sunday evening
in Manchester. I was a college
student, and my girlfriend and
I had been invited to dinner with
our tutor at his house about
18 miles away. We decided to go
on my motorcycle, but we hadn’t
realized how cold it was, so we
hadn’t dressed warmly enough, and after ten minutes on the bike
we were absolutely freezing. When we were about half way there,
the bike started to make a funny noise and then stopped. We had
run out of gas. We stood at the side of the road, shivering with cold,
and not sure what to do.
Suddenly a passing car stopped. The driver got out, opened the
trunk of his car, and took out a can of gas. He walked up to my bike,
opened the gas tank, and poured the gas in. He then closed the
tank and got back into his car, without saying a single word, and
drove away. We couldn’t believe our luck. We sometimes wonder if
the man who rescued us was an angel... - Andy

hat is the question we alw ays a sk about successful
people? We want to know what they’re like - what kind
of personalities they have, or how intelligent they
are, or what kind of lifestyles they have, or what special talents
they might have been born with. And we assum e that it is those
personal qualities that explain how that individual ge ts to the top
of his or her profession.
But according to M alcolm Gladwell, in his book Outliers, we
are a sk in g the w rong questions. He thinks that while talent is
obviously a factor, there are two other more im portant on es that
make a person successful. The first of these factors is luck.

He b e gins with the example of sp o rts players. In recent research
done on various gro u p s of elite ice hockey players from Canada
and the Czech Republic, one fascinating fact came to light. In
both countries, it w as discovered that 40% of the players on
the top team s were born between January and March, 30 %
between A p ril and June, 20% between July and September, and
only 10% between October and December. The explanation was
simple. The sch o o l year in these countries runs from January
to December. A boy w ho is ten on January 2 nd will be in the
sam e cla ss a s one w hose 10th birthday is on Decem ber 30 th.
The chances are the first boy w ill be bigger, stronger, and more
coordinated. He is much more likely than the other boy to be
chosen to play on junior teams. He will then get better coaching
than the others, and w ill play m any more games, so w ill a lso get
more practice. In the beginning, his advantage isn ’t so much that
he is more talented, sim ply that he is older. He w as lucky enough
to be born in the first m onths of the year. But by the age of 13 or
14 , with the extra coaching and practice, he really w ill be better
than the others, and far more likely to be successful.

The extra practice is vital, because the second factor that
Gladwell believes is of great im portance in determ ining whether
som ebody is g o in g to be successful or not is what he calls the
“10,000 hours theory.” T h is theory, based on studies in many
different fields, sa y s that in order to get to the very top you
need to put in 10,000 hours of practice, whether it is p laying an
instrum ent or a sport, or program m ing a computer.

Inform, d n.

overload
T £ you type the words "information overload" into Google, you will
1 1 immediately get an information overload - more than 7 million hits
in 0.05 seconds. Some of this information is interesting - for example,
you learn that the phrase "information overload" was first used in 1970,
before the Internet was invented. But much of the information is
not relevant or useful: obscure companies and even more obscure
bloggers.
Information overload is one of the biggest irritations in modern life.
There are news and sports websites to watch, emails that need to be
answered, people who want to chat with you online, and back in the real
world, friends, family, and colleagues who also have things to tell you.
At work, information overload is also causing problems. A recent survey
has shown that many company managers believe that it has made their
jobs less satisfying and has even affected their personal relationships
outside work. Some of them also think that it is bad for their health.

Clearly there is a problem. It is not only the increase in the quantity
of information, it is also the fact that it is everywhere, not just in the
home and in the workplace. Many people today do not go anywhere
without their smartphones. There is no escape from the Internet,

Scientists have highlighted three big worries. First, information
overload can make people feel anxious: There is too much to do and
not enough time to do it. People end up multitasking, which can make
them even more stressed. Second, information overload can make
people less creative. Research shows that people are more likely to
be creative if they are allowed to focus on one thing for some time,
without interruptions. Third, information overload can make people
less productive. People who multitask take much longer and make
many more mistakes than people who do the same tasks one after
another.
What can be done about information overload? One solution is
technological: There is now a computer program or app you can install
called Freedom that disconnects you from the web at preset times.
The second solution involves willpower. Turn off your cell phone and
the Internet from time to time. The manager of an IT company puts
"thinking time" into his schedule when all his electronic devices are
turned off so that he isn't disturbed. This might sound like common
sense. But nowadays, although we have more information than ever
before, we do not always have enough common sense.

HOW DID
HOLLYWOOD
ACTRESS NATALIE
W OOD DIE?
WAS SHE THE 1victim OF A CRIME
OR DID SHE DIE AS A RESULT OF
AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT?
n the cold and rainy night of November 29,1981, the
beautiful and talented actress Natalie W ood mysteriously
fell off her boat, The Splendour, and died. S h e w as found the
next morning, nearly a mile away, floating in the water with
bruises and scratches on her body.

O

M ore than thirty years later, officials still haven’t been able
to 2_____________the mystery of Natalie W o o d ’s death. On
the boat with Natalie that night were her hu sb and — actor
Robert Wagner, a friend— actor Christopher Walken, the
captain— D e n n is Davern, and a few others. Police know
that W agner and W alken had an argument early in the
evening, but they m ade up and W alken went to bed. Police
also know that W ood and W agner had an argument. W ood
then went to bed and when W agner went to look in on her
later, sh e w a sn ’t in her room. N o one heard or sa w Natalie
fall off the boat. Therefore there were no 3_____________to
sa y whether her death w a s a 4_____________or an
accident. In addition , 5_____________w ho were working
on the ca se at the time were not able to find any solid
6_____________t o 7_____________ whether Natalie W ood
w as pushed to her death from the boat. Therefore her
death w as officially ruled an accident— m eaning there w as
no 8_____________for police to arrest and put in jail.
In 2012, a T V new s show investigating Natalie W o o d ’s death
brought new information to Lo s A n ge le s County officials.
The T V news show claimed the bruises and scratches on
her body were proof that she w as indeed the victim of a
murder. Officials have reopened the case and are currently
conducting interviews; however none of the people who
were on the boat that night have been officially named as
9____________ in Natalie’s death. Will LA police eventually
discover the truth about her death? Only time will tell.

The Case for the Defense
by

G raham G reen e
part ı

It was the strangest murder trial I have ever attended. They
named it the Peckham murder in the headlines, although
Northwood Street, where M rs. Parker was found murdered, was
not actually in Peckham.
T h e prisoner was a well-built man with bloodshot eyes. An
ugly m an, one you wouldn’t forget in a hurry —and that was
an im portant point. T he prosecution intended to call four
witnesses who hadn’t forgotten him and who had seen him
hurrying away from the little red house in Northwood Street.
At two o ’clock in the morning M rs. Salm on, who lived at
15 Northwood Street, had been unable to sleep. She heard a
door shut and so she went to the window and saw Adams (the
accused) on the steps of the victim ’s house. He had just come
out and he was wearing gloves. Before he moved away, he had
looked up - at her window.
Henry M acD ougall, who had been driving home late, nearly
ran over Adams at the corner o f Northwood Street because he
was walking in the middle o f the road, looking dazed. And old
M r. W heeler, who lived next door to M rs. Parker, at number 12,
and was woken up by a noise and got up and looked out of the
window, just as M rs. Salmon had done, saw Adams’s back and,
as he turned, those bloodshot eyes. In Laurel Avenue he had
been seen by yet another witness.

“I understand,” the lawyer for the prosecution said, “that the defense
intends to plead ‘mistaken identity.’ Adams’s wife will tell you that
he was with her at two in the m orning on February 14. However,

T h e n an sw er th e q u estio n s w ith a p artn er.

after you have heard the witnesses for the prosecution and examined
carefully the features o f the prisoner, I don’t think you will be
prepared to admit the possibility o f a m istake.”
M rs. Salmon was called again. She was the ideal witness, with her
slight Scottish accent and her expression of honesty and kindness.
There was no malice in her, and no sense of im portance. She told
them what she had seen and how she had rung the police station.
“And do you see the man here in court?”

She said simply, “I couldn’t be m istaken, sir.”
“T h an k you, M rs. Salm on.”

“Now, M rs. Salmon, you must remember that a m an’s life may

“I do remember it, sir.”
“Is your eyesight good?”
“I have never had to wear spectacles, sir.”
“You’re fifty-five years old, aren’t you?”
“Fifty-six, sir.”
“And the man you saw was on the other side of the road, is that right?”
“Yes, sir, he was.”
“And it was two o’clock in the m orning. You must have remarkable
eyes, M rs. Salm on?”
“N o, sir. There was m oonlight, and when the man looked up, he

W ight during the famous 1969 music festival.
I was knocking on doors, trying to sell our
homemade clothespins. One day I came to a very large house,
somewhere in the middle of the island. A very charming American
invited me in. He gave me orange juice and asked me a lot of
questions about my life. He couldn’t understand what I was
saying very well because of my accent, and I couldn’t understand
him much either - he talked very quietly. I sat at his large wooden
kitchen table and told him all about Gypsy life, how hard it could
be, but also the fun we had.
I must have been there for most of the morning, and he got me
to sing a couple of the Gypsy son gs I knew. Before I left he played
me a song on his guitar and gave me a record, which he said was
his, and had the song on. But I didn't have a record player, and I
soon lost the record.
I had no idea who he was, and I forgot about him until I was in
my early twenties. Unfortunately I had gotten into som e trouble
and was in Brixton Prison for burglary. M y sentence was for two
years. We had a vicar who used to visit twice a week, and because
we were bored, we would sometimes attend his sessions. At one
of the sessions he played some music on an old record player, and
as soon as I heard it, I recognized the singer. He told me it was a
man named Bob Dylan and said that if I liked it, he would bring
more of his records to the next meeting. The following week
I spent hours transfixed as I listened to the records. One song
stood out - North Country Blues - it was the song he had sung to
me in the kitchen on the Isle of W ight all those years ago. When
the song had finished, I cried - all the troubles and hardship I had
lived with just poured out of me.
Those sessions with the vicar became my education. With his
guidance and Dylan's poetry, a world opened up to me. He taught
me to read and write, and by the time my prison sentence came
to an end, I had started a journey that transformed my life. With
the vicar’s support I went to college and became a carpenter - I
didn’t look back.

you like to do any o f them ?

If you have th e m o st check m arks in 1-4, the best job for
you would be in the "caring professions." If you are good at
science, you could consider a career in medicine, for example
becoming a doctor or nurse. Alternatively, teaching or social
work are areas th a t would suit your personality.
If you have th e m ost check m arks in 5-8, you should consider
a job involving numbers, for example becoming an accountant or
working in the stock market. The world of business would also
probably appeal to you, especially sales or marketing.
If you have th e m o st check m arks in 9-12, you need a
creative job. Depending on your specific talents you might
enjoy a job in the world of music, art, or literature. Areas tha t
would suit you include publishing, journalism, graphic design,
fashion, or the music industry.
If you have th e m o st check m arks in 13-16, you have an
analytical mind. You would be suitable fo r a job in computer
science or engineering. You also have good spatial sense which
would make architecture and related jobs another possibility.

CLASSIC MCVIES YCU MUST SEE
PLEASE POST YOUR SUGGESTIONS

T h e G o d fa th e r (1972)
The movie The Godfather is 1based on the book by Mario Puzo. The movie was 2_________by Martin
Scorsese. It 3_________Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone and Al Pacino as his son, Michael. The
movie won three Oscars in 1973 for Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Movie, and Best Screenplay.
The movie is 4_________in New York in the 1940s and 50s. It was filmed on 5_________ in New
York and in Sicily.
The movie is about the Corleone family. Vito, “The Godfather,” is head of one of the most powerful
criminal families in the US. Don Vito is a fair but ruthless man, who runs his business by doing
favors and expecting favors in return. The Corleones get involved in a war with other criminal
families because they don’t want to sell drugs. Don Vito is shot and he is seriously injured. While
Don Vito is in the hospital, control of the family passes to his eldest son, Sonny. Sonny is a hothead,
and with him in charge, the war between the various families becomes more violent. Don Vito’s
youngest son, Michael, has always stayed outside the family business, but when Don Vito is shot,
he returns home to do what he can to help the family. He also takes his revenge against the people
who are trying to kill his father. In the end, Sonny is shot and Michael becomes the new Godfather.
I strongly 6_________The Godfather. It has 7_________ , drama, an unforgettable 8_________ ,
and an important message: that violence never really solves anything. The two 9_________, The
Godfather II and The Godfather III are also good, but the first movie is definitely my favorite.

creative things like reading or painting. Third, they spend
more time outdoors, and are usually3in goqdgr shape.

But on the other hand, there are also disadvantages.
For example, children who don’t have a TV may feel
4 diffgT$rjt§ from
school friends, and often won’t
know what they are talking about. Also, it is not true that
all TV
are bad. There are good ones, like

Listening
3 36)))
In te rv ie w e r S o tell me, how did you get involved
in the movie, Dagmara?
D a g m a ra Well, as you probably know, S c h in d le r ’s
L ist was shot in Krakow', in Poland, which is
where 1 live. I was a university student at the time
studying English. The film company set up their
production office here three months before they
started shooting the film , and I got a job there as
a production assistant, preparingand translating
documents and the script.
In te rv ie w e r But how did you get the job as Steven
Spielberg’s interpreter?
D a g m a ra Well, it was a complete coincidence, just
before the shooting started, there w>as a big party
in one o f the hotels in Krakow' for all the actors
and the film crew, and 1 was invited, too. W hen
I arrived at the party, the Polish producer o f the
film came up to me and said, “The woman who
was going to interpret for Steven Spielberg can’t
come, so we need you to interpret his opening
speech.”
In te rv ie w e r How' did you feel about that?
D a g m a ra I couldn’t believe it! I was ju st a student
- i had no experience o f interpretin g-and now
I was going to speak in front o f hundreds o f
people. I was so nervous that I dran k a couple o f
glasses o f champagne to give m yself courage. I
must have done a pretty good job though, because
soon afterwards Spielberg came up to me to say
thank you and then he said, “I’d Iike you to be my
interpreter for the w'hole film .” I was so stunned
I had to pinch myself to believe that this was
happening to me.

3 37)))
In te rv ie w e r S o what exactly did you have to do?
D a g m a ra I had to go to the film set every day and
translate Spielberg’s instructions to the Polish
actors, and also to the extras. 1 had to make
them understand what he w'anted them to do. It
w'as really exciting, and 1 often felt as if I was a
director myself.
In te rv ie w e r So, was it a difficult job?
D a g m a ra Sometimes it was really hard. The worst
thing was when we had to shoot a scene again and
again because Spielberg thought it wasn’t exactly
right. Som e scenes were repeated as many as
16 times - and then sometimes I would think that
maybe it was my fa u lt- that I hadn’t translated
properly what he wanted, so I’d get really nervous.
I remember one scene with lots o f actors in it which
we just couldn’t get right, and Spielberg started
shouting at me because he was stressed. Eventually
we got it right and then he apologized, and I cried
a 1ittle, because 1was also very stressed - and after
that it was all right again.
Interview er So, was Spielberg difficult to work with?
D a g m a ra Not at all. I mean he was very
demanding, I had to do my best every day, but
he was really nice to me. I felt he treated me like
a daughter. For instance, he was always making
sure that I wasn’t cold - it was freezing on the set
m ost o f the time - and he would make sure that I
had a warm coat and gloves and things.
In te rv ie w e r Did you ever get to be an extra?
D a g m a ra Yes, twice! i was going to be in two party
scenes, and 1got to wear beautiful long dresses
and high heels. Unfortunately, one scene didn’t
make it to the final cut o f the film , and before we
started shooting the other one I tripped walking
down some stairs and twisted my ankle really

badly. I was in so much pain that i couldn’t take
part in the filming, and that was the end o f my
acting career. I still have the photos o f me looking
like a girl from the 4 0 s, though!
In te rv ie w e r Have you ever worked with Spielberg
again?
D a g m a ra Yes. A year later he invited me to
interpret for him again, this time during the
premiere o f S c h in d le r ’s L is t in Poland, which
was broadcast live on national television!
Before that, he had also asked me come to work
as a production assistant on his next movie in
Hollywood. 1 was very tempted and thought really
hard about it, but 1 hadn’t finished my studies yet,
and all my family and friends were in Poland - so
in the end I decided not to go.
In te rv ie w e r D o you regret it?
D a g m a ra Not at all. I had my moment, and it was
unforgettable, but that was it!

His plan was based on his own experience o f
being a learner and from talking to educational
experts. He had three main principles:
First, that it was essential to make the work feel
like play. “I f I can do that, the boys will learn,” said
Gareth. T h e second principle was competition.
Gareth says, “Boys absolutely love competition! It
has gone out o f fashion in many schools, but 1 think
it’s really important. Boys have to learn to lose and
to fail and to come back from that. If you’ve never
done that until you go for your first job interview
and don’t get the job, then you’ve got a problem.”
The third thing Gareth thought was important
was to allow boys to take risks. All kinds o f risks.
Not just physical risks like climbing trees, but
doing things like acting in front o f other people.
Doing things that are a little scary, but that are very
motivating ifyou manage to do them.

3 47)))

P a rt 2
W hen Gareth started, he made some changes to
the way the children were learning. The boys spent
a lot o f time outside, and they had PE (physical
education) every day before regular classes began.
They even made their own outdoor classroom.
Gareth also tried to involve the boy’s parents as
much as possible in their education, and he visited
them at their homes on several occasions.
Gareth set up three major activities for the boys
to help improve their language skills. The first
activity was a school debating competition against
the girls. The topic that the children had to debate
was “Computer games should be banncd.”
When they started to prepare for the debate, the
boys weren’t very enthusiastic, but soon they started to
get more involved. In the end the girls won the debate,
but tlie boys had learned to argue and make points, to
express themselves better. They were disappointed
not to have won, but they wanted to do it again.
Next, Gareth organized a Reading World Cup,
where the boys had to read in teams. Some o f the
boys couldn’t read very well, but they all got very
excited about the World Cup and became much
more enthusiastic readers! There was a prize for the
winners, and this really motivated the boys.
Finally, the boys (working with the girls) had to
write thei r own play and perform it at the local theater.
The play they wrote was about Romans and aliens. All
the children, boys and girls, worked really hard and
although some o f them felt very nervous before they
performed the play, it was a great success and the boys
especially were thrilled. Gareth said afterwards, “It
was a risk, and it was scary - but it was good scary.”

A few months ago I was with a Vietnamese friend
o f mine named Ny in California, and we were
driving around the W est Hollywood area, which is a
pretty famous part o f Los A ngeles-you know - the
Sunset Strip, Melrose Avenue, lots o f cool shops
and restaurants...and lots o f movie stars!! Anyway,
it was a hot, sunny day, and we were thirsty, so we
stopped at a cafe for a cold drink and a snack. So,
we sat down at an outside table waiting for the
server when we saw a man walking toward us. He
was wearing a crazy combination o f clothing, and
he kind o f looked like a mess. He had a beard, long
messy brown hair, and lie was wearing a winter
hat in the middle o f summer! Ny said, “Oh, look
at that poor man. He must be homeless. He looks
like he hasn’t taken a shower for some time. He’s
also really thin. He must be hungry-should I give
him some money? She started to look in her bag for
some money, but I looked at him again and just said,
“D on’t!” She couldn't understand why I didn’t want
her to give the man some money, and she thought I
was being very mean and unfriendly.

3 48)))
W hen the man had gone past, I said, “Ny, that man
isn’t homeless. He's Russell Brand, the British
comedian and actor.” He’s one o f the funniest people
in show business. And he definitely isn’t homelesshe has a house in the Hollywood Hills and an
apartment in New York City! And he definitely
doesn’t need any money! He just enjoys wearing
comfortable, old, mismatched clothing. In fact,
Russell Brand often talks to the homeless people he
sees on the streets and gives them money or buys
ı Item food. Even though he looks a little messy and
scary, he's actually a very kind person. Ny was really
surprised. She said that she thought all US celebrities
dressed in designer clothes, and had perfect hair and
makeup all the time. I told her that in the US, you
can’t always judge people by their appearance. A lot
o f people, even famous celebrities, Iike to dress i n old,
mismatched clothing because it’s comfortable, and it
helps them blend in with the crowd better so they can
go quietly about their business.

4 8)))
P a rt 1
Gareth had only eight weeks for the experiment,
during which time he would be teaching three days
a week. His aim was to try to improve the boys’
reading age by six months. On the other two days
the boys would have normal classes with the girls.

4 10)))
P a rt 3
The boys had a great time with Gareth as their
teacher. But at the end o f the eight weeks, had their
reading really improved? in the last week o f the
quarter, they had to take their national reading
exams. The exams were independently marked,
and when the results were announced, the boys had
made great p ro g ress-all o f them had improved
by six months and some o f them had advanced the
equivalent o f two years in just eight weeks!

1 My dream house would be in one o f our national
parks like Yellowstone or Redwood. It would
be totally green - I’d have solar panels and wind
turbines, and I’d collect rainwater. The house
would be made o f wood and would be heated

by wood fires. I would try to live o ff the land as
much as possible, and I’d plant vegetables and
fruit, and maybe have chickens. It would all be
organic, with no pesticides or anything like
that.
My dream house would be in Paris. It'd be on the
top floor o f an old apartment building, and I’d
have a view o f the Eiffel Tower or Notre Dame.
It would be full o f furniture that I'd found in
antique shops, places like that, and amazing
paintings, one ofw hich would turn out to be an
undiscovered Picasso or Matisse. There would
be a beautiful old dining table and chairs for
candlelit dinners... then all I’d need would be the
right person to share it with.
My dream house would be an apartment in Soho
in New York City, it wouldn’t be too b ig - it’d
just have a couple o f bedrooms, and a huge living
room with a home theater, it would be very
modern and incredibly practical, with things like
automatic temperature control, a kitchen with
all the latest gadgets - and i f possible a stove that
would produce amazing meals on its own - I’m a
lazy kind o f guy.
I f I had to choose where to live, I’d choose
Hawaii. S o my dream house would be made o f
glass with the most amazing view o f the beach
from every room in the house, and it would have
indoor and outdoor pools, and maybe a tennis
court - I’m really into sports. 11 would also have
a big indoor aquarium. There’s something so
peaceful about looking at fish. And fabulous
bathrooms o f course.

P aul Bad luck, mate.
R o b Nice shot.
P aul I’ve had years o f practice.
R o b You used to play pool a lot at university.

R o b W hat about me?
P aul D o you remember the great times we had at

R o b Don’t remind me.
P aul Those were the days. But look at you now with

R o b Come o ff it.
P aul it’s true! 1 mean, just look at that shirt.
R o b W hat’s wrong with my shirt?
P aul You look like a businessman! Did you buy it?
R o b Me? No. It was... it was a present from Jenny.
P aul I thought so.
R o b W hat does that mean?
P aul Well, it’s Jenny’s taste.
R o b Yes, and I really like it.
P aul Jenny seems to know what she w a n ts- and she
probably gets it.
R o b T h at’s one o f the things I like about her.

P aul You said it.
R o b Sorry, Paul. We’ve got to go.
P aul Oh come on, Rob. We haven’t even finished

R o b Another time. Jenny’s waiting for us.
P aul Jenny. Right.

P aul Oh, yeah. That was good. So! W hat shall we

R o b W hat do you want to do?
Paul Well... I haven’t been on a dance floor for weeks
now. I’ve got to move my body. Let’s go dancing!

Jen n y I’m going running in the morning. Why
don’t you join me?
P au l No, thanks. I’m not very keen on running.
But I’ve read about this place called Deep Space,
where they play great music. We could go there.
Jen n y A club?
P a u l D on’t you feel like dancing?
Jen n y Not on a Wednesday night. How about going
to the late show at MOMA?
P a u l M O M A ? W hat’s that?
Jen n y M OM A. It’s the Museum o f Modern Art.
There’s a Kandinsky exhibition.
P au l T hat isn’t exactly my idea o f a great night out.
Jen n y W hat about staying in and watching a movie
on TV ?
P au l I’m in New York. I can watch T V anywhere.
Je n n y W ho’s that?
R o b It’s a text from Kerri. She’s doing a gig at the
Bowery Ballroom.
P au l Kerri who?
R o b Kerri Johnson. I interviewed her last week.
P a u l Kerri Johnson? I’ve seen her play live. She's
cool. Do you like her Jenny?
Jen n y I have to admit I'm not crazy about her music
... or her for that matter.
P a u l I didn’t think so. So shall we go there?
R o b Why not? Actually Kerri's staying very near
here and she doesn't know New York very well.
We could meet her outside and go together.
P au l T h at’s a great idea!
R o b I’ll send her a text.
Je n n y I think I might have an early night. You two
can go on your own.
R o b Are you sure you don’t mind?
P au l O f course she doesn't mind!
Jen n y No, Rob, it’s fine. I have another busy day
tomorrow. You do too, actually.
R o b I know, we’re meeting Don. I haven’t
forgotten.
R o b It’s Kerri. She’s on her way now.
P a u l W hat are we waiting for? Let’s go!

R o b T h at’s right. He’s o f f to Boston this afternoon.
Jen n y Maybe that’s a good thing. I mean, it’s not

Jen n y I have to go. Talk to you later.
D o n Jenny, have you seen Rob? I wanted to have
a word with him before the meeting and he isn’t
even here.
Je n n y I know. He just called to say he can’t make it.
D o n He what?
Jen n y I was with him last night. He wasn’t feeling
very well. But it’s OK. He told me everything I
need to know for the meeting.
D o n Oh. O K then.
Je n n y You know Rob. He's such a professional.

H o st We're talking about great new shopping
websites and 1think we have time for one more.
Janice, can you tell us about it?
Ja n ic e Well, it's called N e v e r l i k e d it a n y w a y d o t
c o m . It’s a very creative name for a website, as
you’ll hear. This site was the idea o f an American
woman named Annabel Acton. She was living
in New York City with her boyfriend, who was
English. He had invited her to travel to London
with him at Christm as to meet his family. But
five days before Christm as, they broke up. Now,
unlike some o f us, Annabel didn’t want to sit
around crying and eating ice cream. She wanted
to do something positive.
H o st So what gave her the idea for the website?
Ja n ic e Well, after the breakup Annabel was left
with a plane ticket to London that she didn't
need. She also had jewelry that she didn’t want
anymore, and she had tickets to a concert that she
didn’t want to go to without her boyfriend. She
also had paintings that they had bought together,
that she didn’t want on her wall anymore. She
didn’t want any o f these things herself, but she
thought someone somewhere would probably like
to buy them, and that’s what gave her the idea to
set up the website.
H o st W hat exactly is it?
Ja n ic e Well, it’s a website where people who have
just broken up with a partner can sell presents
and other things that they don’t want any more,
maybe because they remind them o f their ex, or
maybe, as the name suggests because they never
liked these things anyway! And the idea, which I
think is gen ius, is that they also tell the personal
story behind the thing they’re selling. Annabel
calls it ‘sell and tell’!
H o st What kind o f things do people sell on the
website?
Ja n ic e Oh, everything-from something as small
as a teddy bear to really expensive things like
an engagement ring or a vacation. To give you
an idea, today on the site one seller is offering
a three-day honeymoon package at a luxury
hotel in New York City, and a woman is selling
her ex-boyfriend’s car. And they’re selling
ail these things at very good prices. So on
n e v e r lik e d ita n y w a y you can get a bargain, and also
help someone who’s going through a breakup.
H o st Thanks Janice, and that’s all we have time
for today ...

I was at Sydney Airport, in Australia, and I got a
taxi to take me to the hotel. A few minutes after
he’d left the airport, the taxi driver said that his
meter was broken, but that he would charge me
$ 5 0 , which was what he said the trip usually
cost, it was my first time in Sydney and o f course
I didn’t have a clue what the usual fare was, so 1
just said OK. But later when I was checking in to
the hotel, I asked the receptionist what the usual
taxi fare was from the airport, and she said about
$ 3 5 .1was really annoyed and I sent an email to
the taxi company, but I never got a reply.
I was traveling in the UK. It was a work trip, and
1 knew that 1was going to have to answer a lot
o f emails during that time, so 1 booked a hotel
in Liverpool where they advertised Wi-Fi in
all the rooms. When I arrived it turned out the
hotel charged £ 1 6 for 24 hours W i-Fi, which is
about the same as I pay fo ra month o f Internet
at home! 1 complained to the man at reception,
but all he said was that I could use the W i-Fi in
the lobby, which was free. I wasn’t very happy
about it. Hotels used to make a lot o f money from
customers by charging a ridiculous amount for
phone calls. Now that everybody uses their cell
to make phone calls, some hotels now charge a
ridiculous amount for Wi-Fi.

when it arrived, the tomato sauce was really hot,
but the pasta and the filling were cold - it was
like they were still frozen. Anyway, I called the

1 said “Sorry, it is cold. D o you want to try it?”

Johnson Bailey presented Man Candles. He argued
that most candles smell like perfume and are
designed for women. One day he was having some
friends over to watch a football game, and his house
smelled like old Chinese food and dirty clothes. The
only candle he had at the tim e was a vanilla-scented
one, and he didn’t want his house to smell like
perfume. That’s why Bailey invented manly candles
that smell like things men enjoy: basketballs, golf
courses, the beach, popcorn, and barbecue sauce. He
even has a horrible-smelling candle you can burn to
get people you don’t lik e-p erh ap s your motherin -law -o u t o f your house. He tried to convince
the Sharks to invest by passingout his candles and
asking them to smell them. The Sharks most wanted
to smell the bad candle, which is Bailey’s best-selling
candle.
Kim Nelson’s idea was a cake business that sells
homemade cakes across the US. These cakes are
made from all natural ingredients like fresh oranges
in the "O h! Oh! Orange” cake or one pound o f grated
carrots in “Daisy’s Carrot Cake.” Kim came up with
the idea because many people don’t have the time
or the talent to bake a delicious, homemade cake
for special occassions like birthdays, graduations,
or anniversaries. Kim says that she has a talent for
baking cakes, and more importantly, she feels it’s her
passion. Kim’s products are currently sold online
in her local area, but she would like to increase
production and sell more cakes across the US. The
cake business is called Daisy Cakes.

The Sharks asked Johnson a lot o f questions, for
example they asked him how much the candles sell
for (1 0 -1 2 dollars a candle) and how much money
they made in sales the year before ($ 5 3 ,0 0 0 ).
Johnson explained that currently, he and his wife
had put over $ 4 0 ,0 0 0 o f their own money into this
product. The Sharks also asked how the candles
were made, to which he answered that he poured
them all into their containers by him self - he didn’t
have any help in his entire candle-making process.
In the end, they decided that they weren’t
interested. Their main reason was they thought
the business ju st wasn’t big enough or interesting
enough, so they couldn’t believe that it would ever
make any money.
The Sharks were impressed by Kim’s
presentation, and they immediately asked to
try her cakes. T hey really loved her cakes and
complimented her on their fresh and delicious taste.
Even though the male Sharks liked K im ’s product,
they were concerned that her company had reached
its p o ten tial- making a respectable $2 7 ,0 0 0 in the
last three months. In the end, Barbara Corcoran,
the only female Shark decided to invest $ 5 0 ,0 0 0
in Kim’s business because she thought there was a
market for Kim ’s product.
And since then?
Kim ’s Daisy Cakes are now being sold online
across the US. She was able to pay Barbara
Corcoran back in only three weeks! And she has
expanded her business by offering new products like
lemon curd.
Although the Sharks thought Johnson’s candles
were funny, it's a good thing they didn’t invest in his

company. Johnson’s website has been shut down and
his candles have disappeared from store shelves.

Apart from the hockey players, he also gives the
examples o f the Beatles, the most famous rock band
o f all time and Bill Gates, the founder o f Microsoft.
The Beatles were really lucky to be invited to play
in Hamburg in 1960. The club owner who invited
them usually only invited bands from London, but
on one trip to the UK he met an entrepreneur from
Liverpool who told him that there were some really
good bands in that city. W hen the Beatles arrived in
Hamburg, they had to work incredibly hard. They
had to play for up to eight hours a night in the club
seven nights a week. As John Lennon said later,
“W e got better and we got more confidence. We
couldn’t help it, with all the experience we got from
playing all night long in the club.” By 1964, when
they became really successful, the Beatles had been
to Hamburg four times, and had already performed
live an estimated 1,200 times, far more than many
bands today perform in their entire careers.
Bill Gates's huge stroke o f good luck came
in 1968, when the high school he was attending
decided to spend some money they’d been given
on a computer. This computer was kept in a little
room that then became the computer club. In 1968,
most c o lle g e s didn’t have a computer club, let alone
schools. From that time on Gates spent most of
his time in the computer room because he and his
friends taught themselves how to use it. “It was my
obsession,” Gates says o f those early high school
years, “i skipped sports. I went up there at night.
We were programming on weekends, it would be a
rare week that we wouldn’t get 2 0 or 3 0 hours in.”
So Gates was unbelievably lucky to have access to a
computer, but o f course he also put in all those hours
o f practice, too.
Talent, Gladwell concludes, is obviously
important, but there are many talented people out
there. W hat makes just a few o f them special is that
they are lucky and that they put in far more hours o f
practice than the rest.

H o st And now it’s time for our book o f the week,
which is T h e W in te r o f o u r D is c o n n e c t by Susan
Maushart. Jeremy, to start with, it’s a good title,
isn’t it?
Je re m y Yes, amazing. And it was a fascinating
experiment and a good read.
H ost Tell us about it.
Jerem y Well, Susan Maushart is a journalist who’s
raising three teenage children. She decided to do
the experiment after reaching a point where she
felt that the whole family, especially her children,
were all living in their own little worlds, with
headphones on, plugged into their laptops or their
iPods or their smartphones and that they weren’t
relating to the other people in the family.
Andrew ' So it wasn’t just her children who were
permanently plugged into an electrical device?
Je re m y Well, she admits that she herself was
addicted to her phone and to her iPod and her
laptop and that she was constantly reading news
sites and googling information, but it was really
her children who were totally dependent on new
technology. In the book she makes the interesting
distinction between “digital immigrants” and
“digital natives.”
C h lo e W hat does that mean?
Je re m y She describes herself as a digital
immigrant, that’s to say someone who didn’t
grow up with digital technology, which is really
anyone who was born beforel 98 0 . Her children
are digital natives, which means that they were
born a f t e r computers and the Internet were
already part o f life.
C h lo e Well, that’s me then.
Je re m y Yes, well, the main difference, she says, is
that digital immigrants use the technology, to

Listening

www.ieltstep.com

find information or to listen to music, but digital
natives live and breathe the technology. So for
them living without it is like living without water,
without electricity.. -in the dark ages.
C h lo e W hat were the rules o f the experiment?
Je re m y The family had to live for six months
without using any electrical gadgets in the house
with a screen. So no smartphones, no TV s, no
laptops or computers, no video consoles, and no
iPods. They w e r e allowed to use technology at
school or at friends’ houses, or in Internet cafes,
and they were allowed to use landline phones. But
everything else was switched o ff for the whole six
months.
S a lly Six months? How on earth did she get the
children to agree?
Je re m y She bribed them. She told them she was
going to write a book about the experiment, and
that they would share in any profits that she made
from the book!
S a lly Wow, that was very smart o f her...

5 20)))
P a rt 2
H o st So what were the results? Was it a positive
experience?
Je re m y At the end o f the book Susan says that it
was a positive experience in every way. At first,
o f course, the kids complained bitterly; they
kept saying they were bored. But then they they
started to talk to each other again, to go and sit in
each other’s rooms and talk. They got interested
in cooking and reading; they went to the movies
together. They played C D s on the C D player and
they actually sat and listened to the music instead
o f just having music on their headphones all the
tim e as background music. And Susan’s 15-yearold son started playing the saxophone again. He
had stopped playing a few years before, but then
he started taking lessons again and even started
giving concerts... Oh, and the children said that
they slept better!
S a lly Oh, well that’s good, yeah. W hat about the
children’s’ schoolwork? I mean, nowadays we sort
o f assume that everyone needs the Internet to do
research for homework and so on.
Je re m y In fact, the children’s school report cards
showed that they all improved. W hen they
needed the Internet, they used the computers at
school or at college (the eldest daughter was in
college), or they went to friends’ houses. But when
they did their homework they did it better than
before because they weren’t m u lti-tasking-they
weren’t doing homework and listening to music
and sending messages all at the same time. So
they concentrated better, and their schoolwork
improved.
A n d rew W hat about, Susan, the mother? Did
she find it difficult to live without modern
technology?
Je re m y W hat she found most difficult was
writing her weekly article for the newspaper
because she had to do it by hand, and not on
her laptop. She says that at the beginning her
hand used to really ache; she ju st wasn’t used
to writing by hand anymore. But that was just a
small problem.
C h lo e Any other negatives?
Je re m y Well, o f course the phone bill for their
landline was huge!
C h lo e Has the experiment had a lasting effect?
Jerem y Susan says that it has. She thinks that they
all get along much better as a family, her son
is still playing the saxophone, and he sold his
video console. They’ve all realized that we live
in a digital world, but that we need to disconnect
from time to time and to reconnect with the
people around us. So they have new rules in the
house - like no TV s in bedrooms and no TV in
the kitchen where they eat. And no wasted hours
on the Internet.
S a lly Sounds great. That would be a good rule for
me, too!

R o b No, I’m not. I’ll even buy the ticket.

H ost O K, so imagine you all did the experiment.
W hat would you miss the most? Sally?
Sally' Well, 1already live without the internet many
weekends because we have a house in the country
in the middle o f nowhere where there’s no
Internet service. S o I know that what I would miss
most is being able to google inform ation, like
the phone number o f a restaurant, or what time
a movie starts. O r even, dare I say it, the sports
scores. I don’t have a TV , so I wouldn’t miss that,
but I would miss not having the Internet.
H o st Andrew?
Andrew ' Well, I just couldn’t live without a
computer or a laptop because 1 work from
home so I don’t have an office to go to, and I
absolutely need the Internet, too. I couldn’t do
the experiment - 1 just wouldn’t be prepared to
go to an Interent cafe all day to work. Susan, the
journalist who did the experiment, only had to
write one column a week, but I work from home
eight hours a day.
H o st Jeremy.
Je re m y 1 think I could do it. I think I could easily
live without any o f these electrical gadgets at
home. I mean, I have my office, so I could use the
Internet there. I don’t use an iPod; I still prefer to
listen to C D s...
C h lo e You old dinosaur.
Je re m y Yes, yes I know... and I don’t watch much
TV. I am very attached to my Blackberry, but
I wouldn't mind using a regular phone for six
months. 1 don’t think there’s anything I’d miss too
much...
H o st And finally Chloe, our only digital native.
C h lo e Well, I'm sorry, but 1 just wouldn't be
prepared to even try the experiment, not even
for a week let alone six months. I wouldn't be
prepared to live without my phone. I use it for
everything, calling, music, the Internet. So, no, I
wouldn’t do it.
H o st Not even i f you were offered money?
C h lo e It would have to be a huge amount o f money.
No, I’m definitely not going to do it!

Until the late 1950s, most American girls
played with baby dolls, which often limited their
imaginations to mother or caregiver roles. At

around the same time, Ruth Handler noticed that
her pre-teen daughter was playing with paper
dolls, giving them adult roles such as actresses
or secretaries. On a trip to Europe, Ruth saw an
adult-figured doll in Germany and brought several
ofthem back to the U S. Handler had the idea that
girls could expand their imagination and play-acting
roles with a doll that looked like an adult. So she and
engineer Jack Ryan redesigned the doll for the US
market and called her Barbie after Ruth’s daughter,
Barbara. The first Barbie dolls were produced in
1959 and sold over 3 5 0 ,0 0 0 in the first year.
Barbie is still popular today, and billions have
been sold around the world since 1959. Mattel, Inc.
the company that produces Barbie, reports that 90
percent o f American girls between the ages o f three
and ten have a Barbie doll.

The Chrysler Building has been one o f the most
iconic New York City landmarks since it was
completed in 1930. Architect W illiam Van Alen
designed the Art Deco building for Walter P.
Chrysler, who owned the automobile company
Chyrsler Corporation. In fact, Van Alen modeled
many o f the building’s decorative features using
Chrysler car parts as inspiration. For example, the
decorations on the outside o f the building for the
thirty-first floor are fashioned after engine parts
from a 1929 Chrysler car.
Today, the Chrysler Building is still considered
one o f the best examples o f Art D eco architecture
in the U S. In fact, it was voted New York City’s
favorite building in 2 0 0 5 by Skyscraper Museum. In
addition, the building appears regularly in movies
and TV shows that film in New York City.
T h e “L O V E ” S c u lp tu re
In 1965, artist Robert Indiana had an idea for a
painting with the word “LO VE” as the main focus.
He decided to break the word up into two lines,
putting the “LO ” on top o f the “ V E.” He then tilted
the “O ” a little, and an iconic American design was
born, in fact, it became so popular that the Museum
o f Modern Art and the United States Postal Service
asked Indiana to create versions o f his “LO VE”
painting for cards and stamps, in the early 1970s,
Indiana made a series o f “LO VE” sculptures for
display in public parks. The first o f these “LO VE”
sculptures was placed in New York City, on the
corner o f Sixth Avenue and Fifty-fifth Street.
Additional “LO VE” sculptures were placed in
New Orleans, Philadelphia, Vancouver,Tokyo, and
Singapore, as well as many other cities.
Unfortunately, Indiana didn’t make much money
from his “LO VE" paintins and sculptures. He never
signed his paintings or applied for copyright, so
he didn’t have legal protection against the many
im itations o f his work.

When Michael Jordon started playing basketball for
the Chicago Bulls in 1984, he had special Nike sneakers
designed for him by Peter Moore. These sneakers were
called the Air Jordan 1, or more sim ply-A ir Jordans.
They were red and black - the Chicago Bulls’s colors.
Because the sneakers did not have any white on them,
Jordan was fined $5,000 by the National Basketball
Association each time lie wore them for a game.
Every year since then, Nike has created a new
pair o fA irjo rd an s to sell. In 1987, Tinker Hatfield
took over the design responsibilites for these
sneakers, and he as been associated with them ever
since. Hatfield introduced the Jumpman logo on the
sneakers, which is a silhouette o f Michael Jordan
dunking a basketball with his legs spread wide.
In 2010, Hatfield designed the Jordan 2010s to
celebrate the sneakers’ twenty-fifth anniversary.

them can be considered suspects without some
kind o f convincing evidence.
In te rv ie w e r W hat about Robert Wagner? There
are reports that he was jealous o f his wife’s
friendship with Mr. Walken.
D e te c tiv e R y a n W ell,yes, Mr. Wagner wrote in
h is book P ie c e s o f M y H e a r t that he was jealous
o f the relationship, and that he and Mr. Walken
argued that night on the boat. But that doesn’t
make him a suspect.
In te rv ie w e r And Christopher Walken, M s. Wood’s
friend and co-star?
D e te c tiv e R yan Mr. Walken has remained mostly
silent about what happened that night, but he has
talked to the police.
In te rv ie w e r The boat captain changed his story
about what happened that night, didn’t he?That
he originally lied to police the night Natalie died.
D e te c tiv e R y a n Yes. Mr. Davern told a TV
news program that he lied about the events o f
that night. He now says that Mr. Wagner and
Ms. Wood had an argument, and that M s. Wood
went missing shortly after. Mr. Davern also
claims that Mr. Wagner delayed contacting the
police, implying that Mr. Wagner was responsible
for Ms. W ood’s death.
In te rv ie w e r Do you believe the captain's new
story?
D etectiv e Ryan Well, no. I think the timing o f his
new story is suspicious since he released it so close
to the thirty-year anniversary o f her death. I think
lie was looking to make some money by bringing
this sad story hack into the news.
In te rv ie w e r So, what doyoii think happened that
night?
D e te c tiv e R y a n I can't tell you because I don’t
know.
In te rv ie w e r Soyou don’t think we’ll ever solve the
mystery?
D e te c tiv e R y a n No, I wouldn’t say that. 1think
one day the mystery w ill be solved. Some new
evidence will appear and we’ll be able to say that
Natalie Wood’s mysterious death is finally solved.
But right now, it’s still a mystery, and people like a
good mystery.
