       interviewing, the latest trend in which
       interviewers throw bizarre questions at

       interviewing is deadly serious. The idea is
       to see how quickly job seekers think on their
       feet and, at a time when 25 percent o f recent
       graduates are unemployed, it offers employers
                                                                                         A Tyrannosaurus rex\
    io a new way of separating the brilliant
       candidates from the merely very good.
       This new approach to selecting candidates
       comes from Silicon Valley in California —
       where else? Google, famous for its demanding
    is interview process, asked a recent candidate:
       “You are stranded on a desert island. You have
       60 seconds to choose people o f 10 professions
       to come with you. Who do you choose? Go!”
         One o f the early pioneers of extreme interviewing was Steve Jobs, cofounder o f Apple, who could be               Glossary

         the answer. It is in the candidate’s reaction.                                                                     o f the world’s largest

       someone an opportunity to show they are smart and not easily flustered.”                                             whose job it is to

         “Most candidates actually get something out o f it, it’s not about trying to crush them. We are trying to give     necessary skills to work
                                                                                                                            for a company and to

                                                                          After examining me, she told me that my heart rate was a

                  Oh, no!

JUNGLE
The four men set off from the town of Apolo and soon they had left
civilization far behind. But after walking for m ore than a week, there was
no sign of the village and tensions began to appear in the group. The
three friends started to suspect that Karl, the guide, didn't really know
where the Indian village was. Yossi and Kevin began to get fed up with
their friend M arcus because he was com plaining about everything,
especially his feet, which had become infected and were hurting.
Eventually they decided to abandon the search for the village and just
to hike back to Apolo (instead of rafting), the way they had come. But
Kevin was furious because he thought that it was Marcus’s fault that
they had had to cut short their adventure. So he decided that he would
raft down the river, and he persuaded Yossi to join him, but he didn't
want Marcus to com e with them. Marcus and Karl decided to go back
to Apolo on foot. The three friends agreed to meet in a hotel in the capital
La Paz in a week.
Early the next m orning the two pairs of travelers said goodbye and
set off on their different journeys...

      What's the first thing tourists do when they come out of the Times Square
      subway station in New York City? They look up at the tall buildings, and
      then they pose to have their photo taken. When they're looking up, or
      looking at the camera, that's the moment when a pickpocket steals their
      wallet. Thieves also love the posters you see that warn tourists: “ Watch
      out for pickpockets!” When men read that, their natural reaction is to
      immediately put their hand on the pocket where their wallet is, to make
      sure it's still there. The pickpockets are watching, and so they see exactly
      where the man is carrying his wallet.

          call 911 or get someone else
          to do it.
    b The first thing to do is cool the
2     bum under cold running water
      for at least ten minutes. This
      will make the bum less painful
      and reduce swelling and scarring.
      Then cover the bum with plastic
      wrap or a clean plastic bag if
      your foot or hand is burned.
      This prevents infection and
      keeps air from the surface of
      the skin, which reduces pain. If it’s a serious bum , call
      911 because it m ay need im m ediate medical treatm ent.
    a You should im m ediately put

3     pressure on the wound to stop
      or slow down the bleeding. Use
      whatever is available - like a
      T-shirt or other clean cloth, or                                b   Tell B your story in your own w ords, e.g., It was in
      even your hand. Get help as                                         January a few years ago and I was on a flight from New
      soon as possible by calling 911.                                    York to North C aro lin a...
      Keep pressure on the wound
      until help arrives.                                             c   Now listen to B ’s story.

               important thing is to be ready for it. 80 percent of all accidents

            may not be true if you have children
            coming to visit. Here are some tips
            to prevent accidents./First look at
            the bedroom where the children
            are going to sleep. Make sure the
            beds are not under a window, in
            case a child tries to climb out. If a
            very small child is going to sleep in
            the bed, you could put some pillows          at the kitchen, which is the most

            this can be dangerous, as children           follow this simple advice, children
            may find them and think they are             who come to stay will never be at
